Mr. BROWN. Madam Speaker, a week ago, Americans and this Chamber lived through one of our darkest days. The Commander in Chief incited a mob of insurrectionists to overturn the results of a free and fair election through terror and intimidation. They failed, but this violence took its toll. People died; our country’s temple of democracy was vandalized; and our image as the world’s leading democracy was shaken. President Trump represents a real threat to our national security, our democratic institutions, and the people of this country. We cannot let Donald Trump, who actively orchestrated sedition, lead our Nation’s government for another 7 days. We cannot wait until January 20. Donald Trump must be removed.

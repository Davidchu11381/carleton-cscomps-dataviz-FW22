      "Mr. NORMAN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to read a letter from the Dudykevych family, who are originally from Ukraine and are now living in Tega Cay, South Carolina. They still have family who refuse to leave their homes and their country which, as we all know by now, is under brutal at-tack by the Russians. The father of the Dudykevych family literally built their home with his own hands, which is now being destroyed for one reason and one reason alone— they desire freedom. The heartfelt letter reads like this: ‘‘To President Biden and to Members of the 117th Congress of the United States of America, we highly appre-ciate your legislative initiatives and clear stance against the cruel and dia-bolic Russian aggression against Ukraine. ‘‘Today, I am urgently asking you to actively support immediate delivery of Eastern European fighter planes to Ukraine. The brave Ukrainian Army and the country’s heroic citizens are winning the war on the ground. ‘‘The problem is that Ukraine’s cities are being destroyed and the citizens are being murdered from the air. I am requesting your urgent help in con-vincing the White House that imme-diate delivery of MiG planes to Ukraine should be the highest priority in support of a free Ukraine. ‘‘What we are witnessing is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. We have an ability in this country and in the allied bases in Europe to stop these murderous attacks from the air. We have a moral obligation to do so. Our words are meant to reinforce President Zelenskyy’s urgent demand for fighter planes. ‘‘Ukrainian cities are lying in ruins, and thousands of citizens are dead and will keep dying because Ukraine’s de-nial of fighter jets. These planes will protect the Ukrainian sky from Rus-sian air raids. ‘‘There are MiG–29 warplanes sitting at Allied bases in Europe ready for an immediate transfer. Ukrainian pilots are well-trained on these warplanes and can use them to stop the mur-derous attacks from the air tonight. ‘‘We can no longer sit back and watch schools, hospitals, homes, apart-ment buildings, bomb shelters, every-day people of all ages being mass mur-dered on a daily basis. ‘‘The news that a mother in labor and her unborn baby died after a maternity ward was bombed in Mariupol broke my heart. It is a tragedy that could have been prevented if Ukraine had the planes to defend the sky. ‘‘I know you deal with many requests, but this is an existential need. Ukraine will not survive without your support. Nothing means more to me at this moment. The world is in desperate need of American leadership. Sin-cerely, Mila Dudykevych.’’ This letter was emailed to me 12 days ago on Sunday, March 27, at 2:50 p.m. We all have seen the death and destruc-tion that has occurred since this date, all which could have been avoided if this President had exercised leadership months ago by allowing for the release of the fighter jets, which he failed then and continues to fail now by refusing to honor the request of a desperate Ukrainian people whose only desire is to live in a free country for which they are willing to fight and die. President Biden, the Ukrainian people and all the free people around the world do not deserve this type of bla-tant incompetence and willful neglect by the leader of the free world. Histo-rians will record this truly sad course of events for all the world to see in the coming months and years. Mr. Presi-dent, the words that will be recorded in the annals of history will not be kind. \n",

      "Mr. QUIGLEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, this weekend, the world watched in horror as the retreat of Russian forces from  the town of Bucha revealed the scope of the appalling war crimes committed by Vladimir Putin’s military. Journalists and the Ukrainian military discovered mass graves, bodies left in the streets, and the evidence of a massacre of civilians. These are war crimes. We know now, with certainty, what fate awaits Ukrainians who are sub-jected to Russian occupation. The United States must open its doors to welcome Ukrainians who are fleeing this invasion. As co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, early on in the con-flict, I and others called on the Biden administration to extend temporary protected status to Ukrainians already in the United States. I was proud when the President heeded that call and when he subsequently increased the refugee cap. We must do everything in our power to accept fleeing refugees expedi-tiously. This is a matter of life and death. Over 4 million refugees have al-ready fled the violence in Ukraine. Half of those refugees are children. Millions more remain trapped in cities and vil-lages without access to food, clean water, or medical care. We now know that Putin’s military is willing to slaughter any innocents left behind. It is absolutely critical that the U.S. do everything in its power to assist the people of Ukraine. This means military assistance, yes, but it also means providing for Ukrain-ians who make the difficult decision to leave their homes behind. We must support the nations that are already taking in refugees. Allies, like Poland, have already admitted more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees into their nation, and we should ensure that Poland and other countries that have opened their doors are able to help these Ukrainians resettle safely. This also means continuing to investigate the reports of refugees of color being turned away at border crossings. Here in the U.S., we have a long his-tory as a safe harbor for people of the world. It has been inspiring to see Americans offer unwavering support for Ukraine from the outset of the Russian invasion. I am confident that this sup-port will mean Americans will rally to-gether to support any Ukrainian refu-gees who arrive on our shores. As they do, Congress has an opportunity to re-form our immigration system to be more welcoming to individuals around the world who are in need. I share the outrage of my constituents who are watching what is unfold-ing in Ukraine. As an advocate for Ukrainians here at home and abroad, I am also reminded that there are other atrocities occurring around the world. We can, and must, extend the same outrage we have for the crimes in Bucha to the crimes in Syria, the con-flict in Tigray, the famine in Yemen, and the violence in the Northern Tri-angle. And just as we open our doors to Ukrainian refugees, we can, and must, open our doors to refugees from around the world. In recent weeks, I have urged the Biden administration to end title 42. This policy allowed the U.S. to use the pandemic as justification for expelling migrants without a hearing before an immigration judge. The administration just announced last week that they in-tend to end this policy. One immediate effect will be that Ukrainians arriving at our borders will be able to seek asylum more easily, but, critically, it also means that mi-grants from the global south will no longer be stranded in the immigration process. The Federal Government should seek out other avenues in which providing recourse for Ukrainians will make our system more equitable for all immigrants. Since the beginning of the pandemic, foreign citizens seeking entry into the U.S. have faced months-long waits for counselor appointments. That backlog now threatens to prevent fleeing Ukrainians from reaching our shores. The lengthy immigrant visa delays have caused many Ukrainians to turn to nonimmigrant visas so they can reach temporary safety with family or friends in the U.S. Yet, as Ukrainians and other foreign citizens have been in-creasingly forced to utilize non-immigrant visas, wait times have dras-tically increased. Reporting last month showed that wait times in Hungary were 275 days. In Moldova, the wait was 329 days. On February 28, the wait in Warsaw, Po-land, was 86 days. Two days later, the wait was 134 days for visitor visas and more than 40 days for other types. I sincerely hope the State Department finds a way to dramatically de-crease processing times for Ukrainians who have fled their homelands, but we cannot simply prioritize Ukrainian cases and leave all others behind. These wait times impact immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers from around the world. Ukrainians are not the only ones whose lives are in dan-ger. The tragedy in Ukraine has shone a bright spotlight on the need for our en-tire immigration system to be more in-clusive. Congress cannot allow this mo-ment to pass without finally address-ing the flaws in our system. Too many lives hang in the balance for us to do nothing. \n",

      "Mr. WALTZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, on December 25, Volusia County, Florida, lost a great businessman and valued community leader, Mike Jiloty. Through Mike’s hard work and per-sonal approach to business, he received hundreds of industry awards. Serving as the president of United Way of Volusia and Flagler Counties, Mike fought for the health, education, and stability of every person in his commu-nity. He dedicated his time to the FU-TURES Foundation for Volusia County Schools to better prepare students for their careers. As a graduate of the Leadership Florida Class XIV, Mike used his skills as a leader to serve his community and was honored by several organizations, in-cluding the Volusia Association of School Administrators, the Daytona Beach Community College Foundation, the Conklin Center for the Blind, and the Lodging and Hospitality Associa-tion of Volusia County. Madam Speaker, Mike Jiloty is a true example of a servant leader. He sought to inspire others, to make his community a better place, and he is missed dearly. It is my honor to recog-nize him on the floor of the House of Representatives today. HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF JACKIE  ROBINSON INTEGRATING BASEBALL  Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, Jackie Robinson once said, ‘‘A life is not im-portant except in the impact it has on other lives.’’ On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson created a lasting impact on the lives of generations of Americans when he stepped out of the dugout at Ebbets Field before a crowd of more than 26,000 spectators. This moment would change the course of history and have a lasting impact for generations as he broke the color barrier as the first African-American player in pro-fessional baseball history. Jackie Robinson is a true servant leader, and his life and legacy has had a major impact across the country, in-cluding in my own congressional dis-trict, where I am honored to have a piece of his legacy at the Daytona City Island Ballpark where, in 1946, Jackie Robinson played in the very first inte-grated major league baseball spring training game. In 1990, in honor of the life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, the Daytona City Island Ballpark would be renamed the Jackie Robinson Memo-rial Ballpark. Jackie Robinson’s impact was felt across the Nation. It was the first time a Black player competed with a minor league team against a major league team since the color line was imple-mented in baseball in the 1880s. As we observe the 75th anniversary of his cou-rageous act, it is clear the impact and legacy of Jackie Robinson on the ad-vancement of human rights will be ev-erlasting. A1A DESIGNATED AN ALL -AMERICAN ROAD  Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, of the approximately 4 million miles of by-ways and highways that stretch in all directions across the United States, there are very few that come close to the beauty, history, and serenity that encompasses the 72-mile stretch of A1A that runs from St. Johns County, Flor-ida, to Flagler County. Flanked by the Atlantic Ocean and crisscrossing the St. Johns River and Intracoastal Wa-terway, for more than 75 years the A1A  has provided motorists with breathtaking views as it seamlessly inter-twines Florida’s most remarkable coastal landscapes and deep-rooted his-tory. As a kid growing up in northeast Florida, any drive along the A1A scenic and historic coastal byway was a re-minder of how lucky we were to live in such a beautiful place. Now, as the Representative of Florida’s north central region, home to beautiful segments of A1A, I was proud to cast one of my very first votes in support of the Reviving America’s Sce-nic Byways Act in February of 2019. This act requires the Department of Transportation to issue a request for nominations to be designated under the National Scenic Byways Program and make publicly available a list speci-fying the roads designated. President Trump signed the bill into law in Sep-tember of 2019. I am pleased to announce in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD that on March 29 of 2022, the ribbon-cutting ceremony oc-curred for the Federal Highway Admin-istration’s designation of this beautiful stretch of A1A as an All-American Road. \n",

      "Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of a remarkable public servant, leader, and educator, Dr. Terrance Newton. Today, family, friends, and his beloved Warner School community are saying good-bye to a person who they called Newt. Dr. Newton was a fixture in the Delaware education system for decades, himself a product of Wilmington’s East Side, a Kappa Alpha Psi man, and a Delaware State University man. Newt would become known to his students as their most fervent advo-cate and ally. Every morning, he would stand on the front steps of Warner Ele-mentary and greet students as they passed through the front doors, hug-ging them, high-fiving them, and in-spiring every child. Dr. Newton was always looking for unique and impactful ways to connect with his students, going so far as to open a barbershop where he could cut the students’ hair in school, giving them a safe space to talk about their academics, their communities, and their lives. It is no exaggeration to say that Dr. Terrance Newton was a powerful pillar of the community, a real-life superhero who spent every day devoted to the next generation of Delawareans. We have lost Dr. Terrance Newton far too soon, but because of all the energy, inspiration, and love that he poured into his students, family, and commu-nity, his legacy will live on for a lifetime. To his family, colleagues, students, friends, I send sincere condolences. Madam Speaker, I close with some words from Dr. Newton himself. He said of his students: ‘‘When I see them, I see me. So, my goal is to change the world.’’ Indeed, Dr. Newton, you did. \n",

      "Mr. LAMALFA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. L AMALFA. Madam Speaker, I have been speaking a little bit lately about our supply chain issues and the effects of inflation on real Americans, real families, and talking a lot about food grown in this country and the ef-fects of some of the decisions made by government on the ability to grow food, especially in my home State of California, which affects so much of the supply chain for fruits, vegetables, and nut products that the whole coun-try, and even the world export market, enjoys and uses. What we are wrestling with right now are decisions made by Federal and State agencies on the effects of water supply in California and the ripple ef-fect it has on so many products. For example, earlier this year, a decision was made to withdraw what is called a TUCP, a temporary urgency change petition, for the amount of water that would be flowing from our storage in California out through the delta and into the Pacific. This is geared toward how much water is going to be there for delta salinity and fish habitat situations in the delta and up-stream, somewhat. There was an opportunity back in December and January to curtail some of the water flows that were coming out of limited storage we already have in the State of California, mainly Shas-ta Dam and Oroville Dam, this on the heels of a drought last year. Lake Oroville, for example, hit its lowest number ever. It didn’t even make hydropower for the first time in 50 years because the lake was so low. So, decisions were made based on a pretty decent amount of rainfall in Oc-tober and quite a bit of rain and snowpack in December to withdraw what was called the TUCP, the tem-porary urgency change petition, which would have the ability to let less water out through the delta and a little less for the salinity and fish habitat issues. By the way, the fish, one of the ones we are talking about, is called the delta smelt. They haven’t found one, in what they call trawls looking for the fish, in 3 years. They are pretty much nonexistent. Yet, we are still allowing hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of precious water to go out through the bay to somehow try to mitigate that situation. They decided to withdraw the change petition, the TUCP, a decision made on January 21, to say we are going to go ahead and let the water flow at a high-er level than is necessary. Water will be trickling out of our dams, out of our storage, at a rate much more than is needed for a perception of salinity or fish. At the time when we are looking at drought in California, low water sup-plies, and all the unrest we have in the world’s food supply chain—Hungary, for example, is not going to export grain this year. Russia and Ukraine had been world market participants in grain, especially Ukraine. Ukraine is a very, very rich country in wheat and many other ag products. Their farmers, right now, are out there trying to plant crops amidst all the bombs being dropped on them by Rus-sia. God bless them. But farmers in this country are having bombs dropped on them by Federal and State agencies taking their water away. At a point where we could have curtailed a little bit of the water going out through the delta and kept it for ag use to grow rice, to grow almonds, to grow olives, to grow tomatoes, many things that we need, they decided on January 21, no, we are just going to let the water go out at the same rate. At that point, Lake Shasta was only at 35 percent of its capacity. Lake Oroville was only at 45 percent of its capacity. They thought, well, we are going to bank on the idea that more rain is going to come post-January 21 up until maybe April 1, when, histori-cally, the rainfall tapers off. These lakes are both well under half full. They decided, no, we have plenty of water because we had a massive amount of rain and snow in December. I mean, they threw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, in making this decision because anybody could have seen that we needed to keep every drop in those lakes that is coming in there to build them up. Now, had they reached the flood stage where they have to allow a buffer of space in the dams to provide for flood control, which is approximately about 850 feet of elevation in Oroville and, I am going to guess, about 70, 75 percent of capacity—they are well below that. They thought, oh, we are going to have so much water coming in that we will meet these marks. Well, guess what? The rain did not come in the latter part of January or February or March, and now we are in the first few days of April. Here at this point, we are going to be short on food, short on water, and they are just now thinking about putting the TUCP in here in early April. It is very shortsighted and appalling. \n",

      "Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes.  Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of an inspir-ing leader, a great visionary, and my friend, Dr. Tom Rivera. Dr. Tom was born on September 22, 1939, in Colton, California. After grad-uating from Colton High School, he at-tended San Bernardino Valley College; California State University, Los Ange-les; the University of California, River-side; and eventually UCLA, where he earned his doctorate in education. It was at Cal State LA that he met the love of his life, Dr. Lily Rivera, who shared his passion for service. To-gether, they served in the Peace Corps in Colombia, South America, before marrying in 1965. In all that he did, Dr. Tom strived to inspire his students to achieve their dreams. As associate dean for under-graduate studies at CSU San Bernardino, he was a pillar of the com-munity. He devoted himself to the em-powerment of local youth and main-tained leadership roles in organizations including the Kiwanis Club of Greater San Bernardino, LULAC, the Pure Land Foundation, and more. Dr. Tom was relentless in his advocacy. Even in the face of his own health challenges, he continued his pursuit of a better future where His-panic youth could achieve their dreams. In 1984, just 3 years after contracting a virus that left him paralyzed, he helped found the Inland Empire Future Leaders Program, joining forces with fellow educators, Susan Castro, Frank Acosta, Henry Vasquez, and Bill Alli-son. Dr. Tom founded the organization to address dropout rates among Hispanic students. His vision was to encourage youth to be proud of their roots and to make a difference in their commu-nities. All these years later, that vision is fulfilled in the Inland Empire Future Leaders Program’s tremendous success. It is fulfilled in the educators, lawyers, doctors, and countless other Inland Empire Future Leaders Program grad-uates who have gone on to achieve so many great things. It is fulfilled right here in the Halls of Congress with the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ), my good friend, as Democratic Caucus vice chair, and with me as chair of the Con-gressional Hispanic Caucus. I stand here because of Dr. Tom. Back in the early years, in 1986, I at-tended one of IEFLP’s leadership trainings at Camp Seeley. That sum-mer left a lasting mark on me and changed the course of my future. I learned the tools of leadership and returned home, motivated to serve the community. I became the first in Coachella Valley High School to be class president and ASB president all 4 years, and I learned to identify prob-lems that needed to be addressed and to become a part of the solution. The experience strengthened my dream and my resolve to become a doc-tor and serve the community. You see, Dr. Tom’s guidance fueled in me a pas-sion for social justice, a passion I lived as a pre-med student organizer at UCLA. It is with Dr. Tom’s encouragement that I applied to Harvard Medical School to earn my medical degree and graduate with my master’s in public health and my master’s in public pol-icy from Harvard University. I am forever indebted to Dr. Tom for his unyielding devotion to my growth and the success of my peers. He was al-ways there for us. He was always there to motivate us, to celebrate us, and to give us a smile when we needed it most. He gave us a family, a familia, in which we found reassurance and strength. All IEFLP graduates share a common bond because of him. To this day, when I meet a fellow Inland Em-pire Future Leaders Program graduate, we reminisce about his kindness and grace. We said good-bye to Dr. Tom just last month, in March 2022. However, we know that his legacy will live on in each and every one of us. We know that his memory will survive in the hearts of his beloved wife, Dr. Lily; his broth-er, Ray; his children, Evelyn, Patricia, and Tom; and all of his wonderful grandchildren. Together, we mourn his passing and celebrate his full life, knowing that he was a good man and an extraordinary public servant whose impact will be felt for generations to come. \n",

      "Mr. AGUILAR ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to follow the words of my good friend, Dr. RAUL RUIZ, as we honor this towering figure from our re-gion, the Inland Empire. For more than 50 years, Dr. Rivera served our community as an educator, administrator, and community leader. His passing in March was felt by all of us, and it left too large of a void for just one of us to fill. Back in 1985, our region suffered. More than half of the Latino students in our region didn’t finish high school. While others ignored the problem, Dr. Tom rolled up his sleeves as an elected school board member, as a life-long educator. He joined with commu-nity leaders to form the Inland Empire Future Leaders Program to help these students stay in school. b1030 As a result, more than 99 percent of the students who go through this pro-gram have graduated high school. Ninety percent have gone to college. Dr. Tom’s positive influence, his beliefs in what we could become if given the opportunity, helped shape doctors, law-yers, teachers, and, yes, a couple Mem-bers of Congress. Dr. Tom gave working-class kids like me a chance for a better life, for our-selves and for our family, and he taught us that no matter where life takes us, never lose sight of our herit-age and our culture, and always give back to our community. It is a testament to his unwavering faith in our young people that Dr. RAUL RUIZand I are standing on the House floor today. I was proud to call Dr. Tom a mentor, a friend, and impor-tantly, a constituent. He would always ask me how my grandmother was doing. He went to school on the south side of Colton with members of my family, and he always took the time to ask how they were doing, what they were up to, how he could help them. My thoughts go out to his wife, Dr. Lily Rivera, his children, and grand-children. Madam Speaker, now it is our responsibility, those of us in roles of making policy, those of us in our com-munities who strive to make our com-munity a better place, it is up to us to carry his legacy forward and to lift up the next generation of Latino leaders. \n",

      "Mrs. CHERFILUS -MCCORMICK ). The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to emphasize my concern about President Biden’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, com-monly known as KBJ, and to express my deep disappointment for any Sen-ator that votes for her confirmation this week. While I do not have a vote on KBJ’s confirmation, I do have a voice. And I will continue using my voice to tell the American people the truth. The truth is that Ketanji Brown Jackson is incapable of holding crimi-nals accountable. Throughout her career, Judge Jackson’s sentences have been drastically lower than the national average, even for individuals who have committed the most egregious crimes imaginable. When analyzing all criminal case sentencing imposed by U.S. District Courts, Judge Jackson issued signifi-cantly lighter sentences, almost 34 per-cent less than the national average. Specifically, the statistics reveal a more sinister pattern when broken down to child pornography and child sex torture cases. When sentencing criminals for possession of child pornography, KBJ im-posed sentences 57 percent less than the national average. Additionally, she issued sentences 47 percent less than the national average for those con-victed of distributing these atrocious images of child sex torture. Disturbingly, child sex torture, one of the most heinous crimes of all, is met with compassion and concessions from Judge Jackson.  In fact, here are some quotes from KBJ in the U.S. v. Hawkins cases in-volving Mr. Hawkins, an 18-year-old adult man charged with downloading many images and videos of innocent children being tortured by sex offend-ers. During this case KBJ said: ‘‘I feel so sorry for you’’—in reference to Mr. Hawkins himself—‘‘and for the anguish that this has caused all of you.’’ Judge Jackson feels sorry for the perpetrator. Excuse me? What about the victims and the anguish that this tor-ture has caused them? In addition, KBJ stated: ‘‘This seems to be a situation in which you were fas-cinated by sexual images involving what were essentially your peers.’’ Peers? Really? The vile content Mr. Hawkins possessed depicted boys as young as 8 years old. Mr. Hawkins was 18 at the time, over twice their age. Keep in mind, the sentencing guidelines called for up to 10 years in prison for Mr. Hawkins, yet Ketanji Brown Jackson sentenced this predator to just 3 months in jail. Three months. Madam Speaker, we are not talking about someone who disobeyed traffic laws. This is a man convicted of pos-sessing multiple images of child sex torture. This is sickening and wrong, plain and simple. It is not just Judge Jackson’s record that is worthy of outrage. Revelations from her recent testimony speak vol-umes to KBJ’s interest in legislating from the bench. When asked to provide the definition for the word ‘‘woman,’’ KBJ absurdly said she could not, adding that she isn’t a biologist. Can you think of a more illogical excuse? The word ‘‘woman’’ is a term I am sure that most third graders can accurately describe with ease. By failing to define a woman, Judge Jackson has shown her true narrative to the American people, exposing her loyalty to the woke left. It is no secret that radical activists are waging a bi-zarre and dangerous war on women. From women’s sports to large corpora-tions, liberals are attempting to erase women while claiming to fight for women’s rights. So by refusing to define a woman, Judge Jackson has revealed that she both accepts and supports the left’s treacherous agenda. Furthermore, KBJ’s inability to accept and acknowl-edge the differences between men and women raises serious doubt and ques-tions about her ability to decide judi-cial outcomes regarding sex, such as title IX cases. Bottom line, Ketanji Brown Jackson’s resistance to the realities that exist between men and women is deeply unsettling and proves that she will ad-judicate with an agenda, an immoral agenda that is blatantly wrong for our country. In another disheartening display of her disqualifications, KBJ also refused to recognize Americans’ natural rights. From the founding of our great country, both our citizenry and our govern-ment have acknowledged that we are provided unalienable rights by our cre-ator. It is unconscionable that a nomi-nee to our Nation’s highest court would reject this foundational prin-ciple, and it is alarming that Senators will still ignore KBJ’s appalling testi-mony and vote for her to serve our ju-dicial system for life. Mark my words, Ketanji Brown Jackson’s refusal to acknowledge Ameri-cans’ natural rights from God is a Tro-jan horse for tyranny, presenting yet another glaring example of why she is unfit for the Supreme Court. We know she is soft on crime. We know she is a vessel for the woke left’s dangerous ideology. And we know she cannot definitively defend Americans’ God-given rights or precious freedoms. Yet, despite KBJ’s frightening record and recent testimony, the Senate in-tends to vote on her confirmation to the Supreme Court this week. If KBJ becomes a Supreme Court Justice, she will serve for decades, so-lidifying and strengthening the left’s menacing grip on our rule of law. \n",

      "Ms. STRICKLAND ) for 5 minutes. Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, I stand before you to talk about two topics: The confirmation of Judge Jackson, as well as the Restaurant Re-vitalization Fund. Judge Jackson is more qualified than the people with whom she will serve, and she is not soft on crime. It is why she has the endorsement of the Fra-ternal Order of Police and the Inter-national Association of Police Chiefs, hardly the radical left. As we look at the opportunity to make history, we want to make sure that our Supreme Court is representa-tive and reflective of our entire Nation. Judge Jackson deserves confirmation. She has earned it, and she will be someone that we are proud to have on the Supreme Court. RESTAURANT RELIEF  Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, this week is one to celebrate. After al-most a year of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, the House will finally take up legislation to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and move us one step closer to getting much-needed relief for restaurants across the finish line. The funds provided by Congress in 2021 were a lifeline for so many busi-nesses in Washington State and across our Nation. Restaurants were hit espe-cially hard by highly transmissible COVID–19 variants, staffing shortages, supply chain issues, and inflation, which only added to the existing chal-lenges and long-term effects that brought many to the brink of closing their doors for good. Restaurants have lost 2 years’ worth of revenue, and it will take them years to recover and repay their debts. In fact, in Washington State alone, the average full-service restaurant reports being $160,000 in debt, and it would take them over 3 years to repay it. I know how critical this second round of funding is because I regularly hear about it from my constituents. The south Puget Sound of Washington State is the proud home of so many small, local restaurants, including Vien Dong in the Lincoln International District and Budd Bay Cafe in Olympia, to name a few. Many businesses are still struggling to get back on their feet, and most were shut out from ever receiving relief in the first place. That is why on February 10, I led the Washington State delegation in send-ing a letter to congressional leadership urging them to replenish the Res-taurant Revitalization Fund and help these employers and employees in need as soon as possible. These businesses are often neighborhood anchors and family-owned. They are often owned by women, veterans, minorities, and immigrants. They are a critical part of the south Sound and Washington State’s economy. We must do everything we can to support them and push for an equitable and inclusive recovery. \n",

      "Mr. THOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the full Agriculture Committee hear-ing that we held on March 16, the focus of which was the 2018 farm bill and the role of climate change. Recently, The New York Times wrote a series of stories and produced several videos denigrating rural Americans for providing the country with the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in the history of the world. Let’s set the record straight. U.S. agriculture accounts for less than 10 per-cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and that is according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Over the last 70  years, U.S. agriculture has tripled food and fiber production while usage of land, energy, fertilizer and other inputs has remained steady. Early in the first session of this Congress, several of my Republican col-leagues and I introduced a slate of cli-mate-friendly and farmer-focused bills. These bills are driven by commonsense solutions to benefit our environment and our farm industry. Our farmers, ranchers, foresters, and producers are the original climate champions. While there is more to be done, we must prevent efforts to fun-damentally upend our commodity, con-servation, and crop insurance programs to appease Washington think tanks. We must also reject complicating our pro-grams and making climate the focus of every title of the upcoming farm bill reauthorization. Madam Speaker, under the umbrella of natural land solutions, which in-cludes farmers that grow crops, live-stock, and our foresters, the research has shown that at this moment, based on the technology they use, they are responsible for sequestering 6.1 gigatons of carbon annually, green-house gas emissions. To put that into perspective, that takes care of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are emitted on those lands, plus sequestering an additional 10.1 percent. So truly, the American farmer, rancher, and forester are the climate change champions anywhere in the world because of our science, tech-nology, and innovation. We must ensure agriculture production remains viable in rural America to keep production from increasing in areas of the world with lower environ-mental standards, worse labor condi-tions, and fewer food safety consider-ations. And that is why a robust safety net is critical to keeping farms and production here in the United States while lowering overall global green-house gas emissions. Madam Speaker, our country and our farmers face enormous and immediate challenges including higher food prices, record inflation, and input costs, at-tacks on our energy independence, crop-protection tools, and dependable labor. Now, these are the issues I hear about as I travel my district and the country. These are the issues we should be addressing. I hope at the end of the day we recognize that our voluntary, locally led, in-centive-based conservation system is working as intended, and that we must not undermine its continued success in supporting the environment and pro-ducers. American agriculture is science. American agriculture is technology. And American agriculture is innova-tion. The demands of a 21st century farm economy, and economically via-ble climate solutions, depend on tools and policies that continue to unleash and increase the United States agri-culture productivity. VIRGIN ISLANDS HISTORY \n",

      "Mr. STANTON ). The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT ) for 5 minutes. Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the Virgin Islands and its people speak of great resilience. We are a people rich in history and agriculture, struggles and triumphs in the face of disenfranchise-ment. March 31, 2022, marked 104 years that the Virgin Islands of the United States have been part of the United States. Our islands were acquired by the United States in the costliest per-acre sale in U.S. land purchase. We became the most easterly point of the United States, and served to protect the Carib-bean Basin and the Panama Canal, par-ticularly during World War I. The sale of the Danish West Indies pulled Denmark out of depression and gave them the capital resources, gold bullion, necessary for them to become the happiest country that we know today. The brutal slavery and serf sys-tem that they inflicted on my ances-tors, however, was not a happy time. During the transfer of ceremonies on March 31, 1917, the people of the Virgin Islands, my people, were citizens of no country. All four of my grandparents were alive and living on the island of St. Croix at the time of the transfer. Only qualified Danish citizens living in Denmark were able to vote in the plebiscite. b1045 Of my eight great-grandparents, I believe one may have met the land and income requirement mandatory to be able to vote. Only one would have been able to vote for his destiny. And after the purchase, those living in the territory, my grandparents, great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, my family, were citizens of no country, no-where, for 10 years. Yet, after becoming citizens, Virgin Islanders came immediately to Wash-ington and petitioned, pleaded to be part of the draft. You see, Virgin Is-landers, like the other territories, serve and give the ultimate sacrifice in far greater number per capita than those Americans on the mainland. We wanted and still are willing to take on the responsibility, not just the privi-lege. Until the United States began ownership of territories, largely comprised of minority, Black and Brown people, dis-enfranchisement of territories was a temporary condition. From the 1787 Northwest Ordinance until the acquisi-tion of Puerto Rico, lands were deemed territories with the expectation that they would become States. The disenfranchisement and unequal treatment of people in the Virgin Is-lands are de jure law. The Insular Cases decided at the turn of the century in the Plessy v. Ferguson-era by the Su-preme Court, established a doctrine of separate and unequal status for over-seas territories. However, the disenfranchisement and unequal treatment continues today through court cases in the Bush, Obama, Trump, and now Biden admin-istration, through their oral and writ-ten arguments to the Supreme Court, as well as my own colleagues, Con-gress’ unwillingness to grant equal treatment requests made by represent-atives from the territories. My fight in Washington has been to level and create equity, to counter the many ways that such disenfranchise-ment affects our lives, Federal funding, healthcare access, veterans’ benefits, structural damage after natural disas-ters due to longstanding unequitable funding. It is my deepest honor to be grounded by my history, my parents, and my an-cestors from the Virgin Islands, many of whom have played an integral role in the history of this Nation, long even before we were a part of this country; from Denmark Vesey, leader of the Charleston, South Carolina, slave re-volt; David Levy Yulee, the first Jew-ish Senator in the United States; Wil-liam Leidesdorff, the founder of San Francisco; Edward Wilmot Blyden, one of the founders of Liberia; even today, my predecessor, the first female physi-cian of this body as a Member of Con-gress, Donna Christensen; and even this weekend, NCAA Women’s Basket-ball Champion, Aliyah Boston. Our contributions to this Nation are undisputed, and 104 years after our transfer from Denmark to the U.S. pos-session, our claim to full and inviolable rights as citizens of this country are long overdue. \n",

My district is the third poorest Congressional District in the country, and direct funding and aid to support our most vulnerable communities is so critical to communities like mine. I want to take a moment to uplift the work that my team and I have done to deliver for our residents through the community projects funding. I don’t know if folks know, but we have the oldest Boys and Girls Club in the Nation, and they are going to see $2 million in investments to improve the facility in Highland Park so more of our young people can come into a building that is safe and a building that is going to be able to help them thrive. Also, the Urban Neighborhoods Initiative’s Southwest Detroit Creative Connections Collaborative; they are going to be able to create a safe space, community space for our families, es-pecially our youth. This is the commu-nity I grew up in, with 20 different ethnicities.  We are also going to be able to help Detroit homeowners receive home re-pair grants for energy efficiency. En-terprise Community Partners is so eager to be able to work with my sea-soned residents; and my seasoned resi-dents are eager to see their homes be-come not only energy efficient, but also accessible, as many are struggling with access because of disability. The Eastside Community Network is going to be able to establish the Stoudamire Wellness HUB for the eastside Detroit residents who are, right now, struggling to access healthcare. We are also going to be able to help, some relief—and this is just the begin-ning—to help many of our families in Dearborn Heights and Wayne County address the number of families that continue to be impacted by flooding be-cause of Ecorse Creek’s challenges. We are also going to be able to support ProsperUS Detroit Micro Lending to support some of our small businesses and expand some of the work they have already done to Detroit all the way to western Wayne and Inkster. I am also so proud of the investment that we are going to have in the Ruth Ellis Center to provide safe, affordable, identity-affirming housing for marginalized Black and Brown Detroit-ers, especially my LGBTQ-plus youth. I am also going to be able to stand there with my City of Wayne residents to see, finally, the Goudy Park Amphi-theater space be able to be rehabbed. It is a space that many of our schools use for graduations, for gatherings, and just really truly coming together as a community. We are also going to be able to see over 300 of our high school students in the Western Wayne School District, along with the partnership of SEMCA, be able to access vocational tech-nology, career-tech programs. We are also going to see a $2.5 million investment in our Inkster Senior Wellness Center. This is one of—again, Inkster has some of my spectacular seasoned residents, and they are eager, again, to have a space to come to-gether, especially after the challenges during the pandemic. I want to thank Chairwoman DELAURO and the Appropriations Committee staff, and the incredible hard work of my team, for a thoughtful and engaging process that really targeted communities with the most needs. I am proud and committed to continued engagement with all of my 13th Congressional District communities to find funding to address the needs be-cause they truly deserve it. \n",

      "Ms. GARCIA ) for 5 minutes. Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the incredible impact the bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now Act will have on Americans across the Nation. It is no secret diabetes poses a major health burden to Americans across our country. Texas, in particular, suffers greatly from the effects of type 2 diabe-tes. Every day, new Texans are diag-nosed. On top of that, the rate of new cases increases every single year. This topic, Mr. Speaker, hits very close to home. I have seen firsthand the hurdles diabetes creates for fami-lies simply looking to live a quiet life and be alone and have a good, produc-tive life. In my family, my mother faced uphill health battles because of diabetes most of her adult life. She died eventually of diabetes complica-tions. Diabetes runs in my family. In fact, my doctor tells me that no matter what I do, I may end up getting diabe-tes. I am one of 10 children. Five of us have already gotten diabetes and are dependent on insulin. Sadly, this epidemic disproportionately impacts older adults, especially Latinos, minorities, and populations with lower levels of education. It re-mains one of the leading causes of death in Texas and the United States. In my own home county of Harris County, diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death. Even when purchased through Medicare, insulin is more than three times as expensive in the United States than in the U.K. The bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now Act is truly needed to save lives. The Affordable Insulin Now Act caps insulin copays at $35 per month or 25 percent of an insurance plan’s nego-tiated price, whichever is lower. It is a great first step, and it will save lives. But more must be done. You see, Mr. Speaker, Americans without health insurance will not ben-efit from this bill. This will help those residents who are fortunate to already have health insurance, and we welcome this support. Again, it is a great first step. But much more is very needed. Texas is the State with the highest rate of uninsured individuals and, in my district, 33 percent of the residents in my district do not have health in-surance. In fact, Mr. Speaker, my district has the highest number of uninsured people than in any other district in the Na-tion. To make matters worse, diabetes is highly concentrated in east Texas, the area where I live. It pains me that these folks were not included in the bill. The immense health and emotional challenges diabetes brings to house-holds are burdensome enough; but its economic strain is ruthless to families not fortunate enough to have insur-ance. Because of corporate greed and companies focused only on profits, Texans without medical insurance face astro-nomical prices for insulin. In short, people with diabetes have medical ex-penses approximately 2.3 times higher than those who do not have diabetes. The out-of-pocket costs for healthcare and insulin have crippled hardworking Americans across our country. It has gotten so bad that one in four people have rationed, rationed lifesaving insulin because they could not afford proper dosage amounts. This is unacceptable and wrong, and we must do better. No one—I repeat, no one—should have to gamble with their health by ra-tioning insulin to make ends meet. The bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now Act will save lives, and it is a great step forward. But I will continue fighting for residents across my district who do not currently have health insurance but do need insulin. We will continue to fight until we get it done. \n",

      "Mr. DEUTCH ) for 5 minutes. Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, a recently released Violence Project study has found that more than half of all mass shootings between 1966 and 2019 occurred since 2000. There have been more and more shootings. It is getting worse and worse. Mass shootings have occurred in the workplace, on college campuses, in our houses of worship, and in our schools. We must do better. These shootings cut off young lives and devastate families. We owe it to the victims to do more to combat gun violence in our communities. We owe it to Joaquin Oliver. Joaquin was 17 years old when he was shot and killed with an assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. This is Joaquin. But this symbol of Joaquin is also an assault rifle. You see, this is an assault rifle that was purchased by Joaquin’s dad, Manny, without a background check. Manny went to a gun show in Florida and bought a high-powered rifle with-out a background check. Then he went home, and he melted it down to make this statue of his son, who was killed by a similar weapon in his school on Valentine’s Day. This statue of Joaquin is now a powerful reminder of our weak gun laws and the countless American lives that have been stolen, families broken by gun violence. When Manny went to a gun show, the seller pushed him to buy the rifle, to buy ammunition, to buy a high-capac-ity magazine, all at one time, without a background check. And Manny won-dered, what’s the rush? What is the rush? Why does anyone need a deadly arsenal in one afternoon, with no questions asked? We have put a lot of effort into making background checks work well for legal gun buyers. The National Instant Criminal Background System, the NICS system, returns results in as fast as 30 seconds. Every gun buyer at a gun show, every gun buyer online, every gun buyer at a licensed dealer, every gun buyer should  go through that system to keep our communities safe. But they don’t be-cause of a dangerous loophole like the one that allowed Manny to buy an AR– 15 at a gun show without a background check. b1100 The background check system is the foundation of gun safety in America. When that foundation is weak, like it is today, it makes all of us less safe. We need universal background checks. States with laws requiring background checks on all sales have lower gun homicide rates than States that don’t. Guns from States that lack background check laws often end up re-covered from crime scenes in neigh-boring States without those tough laws. That is why we need a uniform national requirement to end weak gun laws that contribute to trafficking. The President visited New York City recently after two police officers were fatally shot, and he urged the need for universal background checks. He right-ly said our country needs a comprehen-sive strategy to dramatically reduce gun violence. The Attorney General of the United States has directed U.S. at-torneys to confront gun trafficking across State lines and in cities. I strongly support the President’s call for a comprehensive strategy. As part of that strategy, Congress should do what many States are currently working on to ban untraceable ghost guns, similar to the law that was signed in New York in October of last year. Congress can do this. Congress should also pass safe storage legislation to protect kids from being harmed by loaded weapons kept unsafely in their homes. We should ban weapons of war that don’t belong in our community and are regularly used to hunt innocent people. Who needs to be able to fire off 50 or 100 rounds at a time? Congress should recognize that high- capacity magazines have no place in our communities and that their only purpose is to make it easy to cause mass casualties. These proposals have significant support. Ninety percent of Americans, in-cluding gun owners, want universal and stronger background checks. Would a stronger background check system prevent every instance of gun violence? No, of course not. Would end-ing large-capacity ammunition maga-zines prevent mass casualties caused by guns? No, but they will make us safer. They will make our communities safer. They will make our schools safer. They will make the workplace safer. They will make people feel safer as they attend religious services. They will make it easier for law enforcement to do their jobs safely every day. Continued inaction on confronting gun violence will only lead to more in-nocent people dying from firearms. Congress must take action to get strong gun violence prevention legisla-tion for Joaquin and the 16 others who were taken at Stoneman Douglas, for their families, and for America. \n",

Private Ladner was assigned to the 126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Infantry Division. On November 30, 1942, during a blockade to prevent a Japanese as-sault on the island of New Guinea, he was killed during the initial wave and was reportedly buried 26 yards west of the road the unit was blockading. After the war, his remains could not be found and eventually were declared nonrecoverable. However, between a little luck and the never-quit Army at-titude and exhaustive research, they located his remains in 2016. Now Private Ladner can be laid to rest in a way he deserves. I know his family takes comfort in his example of a life well lived and the legacy he left behind all those years ago. Private Ladner was part of the Greatest Generation of Americans.

      "Mrs. CHERFILUS -MCCORMICK ) for 5 minutes. Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud President Joe Biden’s executive order to bring down the cost of health insurance and expand health coverage. The executive order represents the most significant action to strengthen the Affordable Care Act since it was signed into law. Consistent with the administration’s mission, my colleagues and I in Con-gress voted in favor of the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which will lower costs for hardworking families by capping the out-of-pocket costs for insulin at $35 per month. President Biden’s executive order delivers a longstanding Democratic pri-ority for strengthening the Affordable Care Act and fixing the so-called fam-ily glitch. Without this step, current regulations define employer-based health insurance as affordable if the coverage is provided solely for the em-ployee and not for family members. For family members of an employee offered health coverage through an em-ployer, the cost for that family cov-erage can sometimes be very expensive and make health insurance out of reach. The family glitch affects 5 mil-lion people and has made it impossible for many families to use the premium tax credit to purchase an affordable, high-quality marketplace plan. Fixing the family glitch builds on several steps Democrats have taken to lower health costs and build on the Af-fordable Care Act, including the Amer-ican Rescue Plan, which was signed into law last year. The American Res-cue Plan is saving families an average of $2,400 in annual premiums and has helped enroll 14.5 million Americans in marketplace plans. Thanks to Democratic leadership, healthcare is more affordable and ac-cessible than ever. Our American Res-cue Plan dramatically lowered the cost of marketplace plans and helped enroll millions of Floridians into quality, af-fordable coverage. As House Democrats fight to build a better America for all people, I will continue to work to lower healthcare costs and prescription drug prices for all Floridian families. \n",

Every day, we are hearing from our constituents about inflation and rising prices, and one critical factor contrib-uting to these issues is continued dis-ruptions in the domestic supply chain. The America COMPETES supply chain subtitle establishes an office of manufacturing security and resilience within the Department of Commerce to monitor, identify, map, and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. It also authorizes billions in grants and loans to support the manufac-turing of critical goods, equipment, and cutting-edge technologies that are essential to our national and economic security. The investments included in the bipartisan America COMPETES supply chain subtitle will allow us to preempt future shocks to our supply chain, and we must be proactive in strengthening our manufacturing capacity to secure our future.

Mr. Speaker, for generations, America’s innovations, from electricity to automobiles, robotics to plastics, have shaped the course of his-tory. We prevailed because we were preeminent in our investments in science, research, and technology. But today, America’s preeminence is being challenged. Other countries have followed our lead in research, science, and technology. As a result, more of the technology that we are relying on today is made abroad, driving up the cost at home, contributing to inflation, threatening our workers’ financial security and their jobs, and eroding our Nation’s competitiveness. That is why Chairwoman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, along with 13 other committees of the House, crafted a data-driven, results-oriented package to help our Nation meet and win in the 21st century. I associate myself with the remarks of the gentlewoman from Michigan in support of the COMPETES Act. The House America COMPETES Act is pre-cisely what is needed to ensure Amer-ica’s might in manufacturing and inno-vation while creating good-paying jobs and lowering costs for our Nation. Our bill helps bring manufacturing back to our shores, including $52 bil-lion for chips, which are crucial for making cars, cell phones, and more. Our bill will help reinvigorate America’s industry, securing $45 billion to strengthen our supply chain, reduce de-pendence on foreign nations, and lower costs. Our bill invests in research and education so that we diversify our STEM workforce with apprenticeships and the rest. And our bill will promote U.S. global leadership. In the spirit of patriotism and unity, the House will champion these prior-ities when we go to conference to craft a bold, bipartisan, bicameral package to send to the President’s desk.

      "Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, our strategic oil reserves are meant to be for emergency use, an emergency re-source in time of war or other disaster. At such an uncertain time that we have, with Eastern Europe embroiled in a big conflict, it would be wise for us to keep the reserve full. Indeed, President Trump filled the reserve up at the time when prices were low on fuel. Now, President Biden thinks that by releasing this oil, it is going to somehow affect the price of oil  around the world and our own economy. It is not. So far, 80 million barrels have already been released, but it hasn’t driv-en down prices. Instead, the reserves we have in the ground that oil people can produce for us are the things that are going to change oil prices, not tap-ping into our reserves. There is only going to be a few days’ worth to run the country on, or bleed-ing it out over 180 days, 1 million bar-rels at a time. Tap into our energy we have so abundantly in this country. That will affect the market for us, for our allies in Eu-rope, and actually truly make a big dif-ference, instead of playing this little game with our oil reserves that doesn’t do anything other than look like we are doing something. Let’s get back to work on putting Americans to work and our energy de-pendability on us and not on others. I ask the President to change directions on this policy. \n",

      "Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, last week, I held an in-person townhall to hear how inflation impacts our commu-nity. Too many Pennsylvanians are making tough choices to put food on the table, gas in their tanks, and other budgetary choices. Today, I rise to discuss why confronting Putin abroad helps address in-flation issues here at home. It is no secret that we live in a global market. We became acutely aware of that fact during the pandemic. Ukraine and Russia provide us, and the world, grain, oil, gas, and even things like fer-tilizer. When we are at war in these areas or people are at war in these areas, this impacts our economy colossally. We are again seeing how connected we are, this time not from a global disease but, rather, from a diseased man. Vladimir Putin is infected, and he is inflicting untold horrors on the people of Ukraine and simultaneously desta-bilizing our world economy and order. To fully address these rising costs and inflation in part caused by this Russian war, our top priority has to be bringing a just, durable, and lasting peace to this conflict in Ukraine. The longer the war rages on, the longer it will take for our economy to recover. That is why we must impose strong sanctions against Russia, co-ordinated with our allies; we must ex-pedite weaponry to Ukraine; and we must return to prepandemic domestic oil production levels to meet our do-mestic needs and to help bring down global market costs. For the people of the Sixth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I promise to keep doing everything in my power to make sure we can alleviate pressures that are felt at home from abroad. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratu-late Mr. Chris Delesandri on his retire-ment after a dedicated 41 years of serv-ice with United Way of Galveston County Mainland, where he served as the executive director for the past 10 years. Not only did Chris serve Galveston County during his time with United Way, but Chris has also served as the president of the Rotary Club of Texas City. He was elected to the Roll of Fame for Rotary District 5910 and earned the Rotary Youth Leadership Awards volunteer. Chris always prioritized giving back to his community, and as such, he has earned several awards through the Chamber of Commerce, such as Citizen of the Year in 2008 and the Leslie Hayley Community Service Award in 2014. I commend Chris for his numerous accomplishments and his dedicated service to our district and congratulate him on his retirement. I am so glad to represent him and call him a friend. He deserves a great retirement. Have a good one, buddy. \n",

      "Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for all the good work that they have done to support American small businesses during the pandemic. Democrats working with President Biden have helped businesses to keep their lights on and employees on pay-roll. Biden’s plan has enabled a remarkable rebound in small business activity with small business demand for labor and inventory near record high. The share of small businesses that have created new jobs in the first quar-ter of this year is higher than at any point in the Trump administration. Democrats are continuing to drive stability and growth in small busi-nesses. H.R. 3807 is in furtherance of that. The bill provides $13 billion to es-tablish a Hard Hit Industry’s Award Program to provide awards to small businesses across all industries and sectors that were hardest hit by the pandemic, regardless of industry or business. My colleagues and I are proposing solutions focused on assisting small busi-nesses, the true engine of our Nation’s economy, to rebuild and help our econ-omy be better than before. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I have visited our southern border three times since I have been in office, and the crisis is only getting worse. Not only have we seen the most illegal crossings on record over the past year, but also fentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of death for Ameri-cans ages 18 to 45, and the top source of fentanyl is the U.S.-Mexico border. The Biden administration’s decision to end title 42 without a plan will only worsen this crisis. It is past time to stop playing politics with border security. Federal law requires the Department of Homeland Security to create and implement a strategy to secure our northern border, but we currently don’t have one that addresses the southern border crisis. I introduced the Comprehensive Southern Border Strategy Act to change that and direct the Department of Homeland Security to create a strat-egy to secure our U.S.-Mexico border. Our economic prosperity, national security, and public safety requires se-cure borders. \n",

Mr. Speaker, the administration is removing healthcare workers, Federal employ-ees, and members of the Armed Forces  from their jobs if they refuse to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, over 160,000 unvaccinated and untested illegal aliens crossed our border last Feb-ruary, the most on record in two dec-ades. Now, Joe Biden and his Washington Democrat allies want to make a bad problem worse. Last week, President Biden eliminated President Trump’s title 42, which allows DHS to deport il-legal aliens if they pose a public health danger to our citizens. In other words, according to Washington Democrats, they believe American healthcare workers, Federal employees, and serv-icemembers deserve harsher treatment than those crossing our border ille-gally. This is unacceptable. Title 42 must be reinstated immediately and kept in place until this administration comes up with a plan to deal with the border crisis created by the administration’s policies. \n",

      "Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the mathematical and statistical sciences. Fundamental research in mathematics and statistics touches all of our Nation’s scientific and technological priorities and provides tools to address societal changes. As recent examples, mathematical scientists model the spread of pandemics and help assess the effec-tiveness of vaccine programs. They produce research needed for artificial intelligence and help us under-stand and predict dangerous weather patterns. And their theoretical work fortifies imaging technologies used to detect diseases, including cancer. We are at a critical time for building and ensuring a stable and more diverse STEM workforce in the future. Mathematics and statistics support all of the STEM disciplines and are critical to our educational system. Every day, mathematicians and statisticians enable advances across all science and technology, making our Nation more secure and globally com-petitive, and training the next genera-tion of researchers and educators.

      "Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to shed light on an im-minent threat to our country’s recent economic prosperity. The Biden administration has created jobs and increased our Nation’s GDP at unprecedented rates. From day one, the President’s economic agenda has been about gener-ating more growth and more innova-tion by giving America’s middle class more opportunities and more financial security. However, oil companies are using the war between Russia and Ukraine as a pretext to engage in unlawful price gouging to rob American people of their hard-earned dollars. I applaud my colleagues for taking the necessary steps to address this con-cern by facilitating oversight hearings to maintain the integrity of the oil in-dustry and hold these companies ac-countable for their unconscionable practices. Hopefully, these testimonies and hearings will lead to changes, and we can truly enjoy all the success of our current administration and keep dol-lars in the pockets of the American people. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act, which would provide badly needed resources to civil society actors in Burma and impose sanctions on the Burmese military for upending years of progress, democracy, and human rights for a self-serving and brutal agenda of repression and violence. Having visited Burma, I have seen the strength of its people as they have struggled to create and sustain democ-racy. Now, under the authoritarian Tatmadaw, the divisions, prejudices, and violence have been exacerbated and progress has been reversed. The Rohingya and other vulnerable populations continue to be displaced and assaulted. Journalists are pur-posely targeted for harassment and vi-olence. The political opposition has faced unspeakable violence and imprisonment. We must commit to holding those responsible for the collapse of democracy and human rights to account, and we must support those that are working in dangerous circumstances to reestablish the rule of law. As we continue to work against global authoritarianism and for democracy and human rights around the world, let us stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Burma and their struggle for freedom. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize seven amazing stu-dents from the Camden Central School District Track and Field team, who re-cently traveled to Mayfield, Kentucky, during their February break to help residents after a devastating tornado ripped through the State 2 months ago. Led by Coach Phil Lucason, seven members of the team volunteered their time: Lizzy Lucason, Will Carver, Ryan Beaulac, Joe Doran, Nate Hurd, Ivy Murphy, and Dillon Melchoire. Inciden-tally, Dillon made a special stop at the University of the Cumberlands in Ken-tucky on the way back to sign a letter of intent to run track for them next year. But these students worked in a large distribution center helping hun-dreds of residents per day, who were seeking food and other household sup-plies. The students also spent time working alongside contractors who were re-building the many buildings devastated by the storm. Their tireless efforts on behalf of those whom they had never met is a beautiful example of selfless service. The 22nd District is so incredibly honored to have these excellent stu-dents representing us and showing just how willing our community is to help people in their greatest time of need.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate House Democrats’ efforts to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month. This bill will be a game changer for the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas and the country as a whole. We have the highest rates of diabetes in the country, and over 25 percent of the pop-ulation is uninsured. The stark reality is that the skyrocketing cost of insulin is crushing south Texans and people across our country. One in four Americans who rely on insulin have been forced to ration or skip a dose or choose between buying groceries and filling prescription drugs. Pharmaceutical companies manufacture insulin for less than $10 yet sell it to the American people for more than 10 times that. I refuse to accept the status quo. This long-overdue legislation is an important step to lower healthcare costs for families and hold Big Pharma accountable. I urge my Senate colleagues to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act and send it to the President’s desk to sign today.  ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE \n",

(6) WAR CRIME .—The term ‘‘war crime’’ has the meaning given the term in section 2441(c) of title 18, United States Code. TITLE I—MATTERS RELATING TO THE CONFLICT IN BURMA SEC. 101. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Since 1988, the United States policy of principled engagement has fostered positive democratic reforms in Burma, with elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020, helping to bring about the partial transition to civilian rule and with the latter 2 elections resulting in re-sounding electoral victories for the National League for Democracy. (2) That democratic transition remained incomplete, with the military retaining sig-nificant power and independence from civil-ian control following the 2015 elections, in-cluding through control of 25 percent of par-liamentary seats, a de facto veto over con-stitutional reform, authority over multiple government ministries, and the ability to op-erate with impunity and no civilian over-sight. (3) Despite some improvements with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms beginning in 2010, and the estab-lishment of a quasi-civilian government fol-lowing credible elections in 2015, Burma’s military leaders have, since 2016, overseen an increase in restrictions to freedom of expres-sion (including for members of the press), freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of as-sociation, and freedom of religion or belief. (4) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military and security forces launched a genocidal military campaign against Rohingya, resulting in a mass exodus of some 750,000 Rohingya from Burma’s Rakhine State into Bangladesh, where they remain. The mili-tary has since taken no steps to improve conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine State, who remain at high risk of genocide and other atrocities, or to create conditions conducive to the voluntary return of Rohingya refugees and other internally dis-placed persons (IDPs). (5) The Burmese military has also engaged in renewed violence with other ethnic minor-ity groups across the country. The military has continued to commit atrocities in Chin, Kachin, Kayah, and Shan. Fighting in north-ern Burma has forced more than 100,000 peo-ple from their homes and into camps for in-ternally displaced persons. The Burmese military continues to heavily proscribe hu-manitarian and media access to conflict-affected populations across the country. (6) With more nearly $470,000,000 in humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in fiscal year 2021, the United States is the largest humanitarian donor to populations in need as a result of conflicts in Burma. In May 2021, the United States announced near-ly $155,000,000 in additional humanitarian as-sistance to meet the urgent needs of Rohingya refugees and host communities in Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing violence in Burma’s Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and Chin states. In September 2021, the United States provided nearly $180,000,000 in additional critical humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma, bringing the total fiscal year 2021 to more than $434,000,000. (7) Both government- and military-initiated investigations into human rights abuses in Burma involving violence between ethnic minorities and Burmese security forces have failed to yield credible results or hold per-petrators accountable. (8) In its report dated September 17, 2018, the United Nations Independent Inter-national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded, on reasonable grounds, that the factors allowing inference of ‘‘genocidal in-tent’’ are present with respect to the attacks against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and acts by Burmese security forces against Rohingya in Rakhine State and other ethnic minori-ties in Kachin and Shan States amount to ‘‘crimes against humanity’’ and ‘‘war crimes’’. The Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar estab-lished by the United Nations Human Rights Council recommended that the United Na-tions Security Council ‘‘should ensure ac-countability for crimes under international law committed in Myanmar, preferably by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court or alternatively by creating an ad hoc international criminal tribunal’’. The Mission also recommended the imposi-tion of targeted economic sanctions, includ-ing an arms embargo on Burma. (9) On December 13, 2018, the United States House of Representatives passed House Reso-lution 1091 (115th Congress), which expressed the sense of the House that ‘‘the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the Bur-mese military and security forces since Au-gust 2017 constitute crimes against human-ity and genocide’’ and called upon the Sec-retary of State to review the available evi-dence and make a similar determination. (10) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 2019, the United Nations Independent Inter-national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar found that the Burmese military’s economic interests ‘‘enable its conduct’’ and that it benefits from and supports extractive indus-try businesses operating in conflict-affected areas in northern Burma, including natural resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals  and gems and argued that ‘‘through controlling its own business empire, the Tatmadaw can evade the accountability and oversight that normally arise from civilian oversight of military budgets’’. The report called for the United Nations and individual govern-ments to place targeted sanctions on all sen-ior officials in the Burmese military as well as their economic interests, especially Myanma Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation. (11) On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military conducted a coup d’e ´tat, declaring a year-long state of emergency and detaining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Presi-dent Win Myint, and dozens of other govern-ment officials and elected members of par-liament, thus derailing Burma’s transition to democracy and disregarding the will of the people of Burma as expressed in the No-vember 2020 general elections, which were determined to be credible by international and national observers. (12) Following the coup, some ousted members of parliament established the Com-mittee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which subsequently released the Federal Democracy Charter in March 2021 and established the National Unity Govern-ment in April 2021. In June 2021, the National Unity Government included ethnic minori-ties and women among its cabinet and re-leased a policy paper outlining pledges to Rohingya and calling for ‘‘justice and rep-arations’’ for the community. (13) Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the Burmese military has— (A) used lethal force on peaceful protestors on multiple occasions, killing more than 1,500 people, including more than 100 chil-dren; (B) detained more than 10,000 peaceful protestors, participants in the Civil Disobe-dience Movement, labor leaders, government officials and elected members of parliament, members of the media, and others, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners; (C) issued laws and directives used to further impede fundamental freedoms, includ-ing freedom of expression (including for members of the press), freedom of peaceful assembly, and freedom of association; and (D) imposed restrictions on the internet and telecommunications. (14) According to the UNHCR, more than 440,000 people have been internally displaced since the coup, while an estimated 39,000 have sought refuge in neighboring countries. Nevertheless, the Burmese military con-tinues to block humanitarian assistance to populations in need. According to the World Health Organization, the military has car-ried out more than 286 attacks on health care entities since the coup and killed at least 30 health workers. Dozens more have been arbitrarily detained, and hundreds have warrants out for their arrest. The military continued such attacks even as they inhib-ited efforts to combat a devastating third wave of COVID–19. The brutality of the Bur-mese military was on full display on March 27, 2021, Armed Forces Day, when, after threatening on state television to shoot pro-testers in the head, security forces killed more than 150 people. (15) The coup represents a continuation of a long pattern of violent and anti-demo-cratic behavior by the military that stretches back decades, with the military having previously taken over Burma in coups d’e ´tat in 1962 and 1988, and having ignored the results of the 1990 elections, and a long history of violently repressing protest movements, including killing and impris-oning thousands of peaceful protestors dur-ing pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 and 2007. (16) On February 11, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14014 in response to the coup d’e ´tat, authorizing sanctions against the Burmese military, its economic interests, and other perpetrators of the coup. (17) Since the issuance of Executive Order 14014, President Biden has taken several steps to impose costs on the Burmese mili-tary and its leadership, including by desig-nating or otherwise imposing targeted sanc-tions with respect to— (A) multiple high-ranking individuals and their family members, including the Com-mander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, Min Aung Hlaing, Burma’s Chief of Police, Than Hlaing, and the Bureau of Special Op-erations commander, Lieutenant General Aung Soe, and over 35 other individuals; (B) state-owned and military controlled companies, including Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company, Ltd., Myanmar Economic Corporation, Ltd., Myanmar Eco-nomic Holdings Ltd., Myanmar Ruby Enter-prise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co., Ltd., and Myanma Gems Enterprise; and (C) other corporate entities, Burmese military units, and Burmese military entities, including the military regime’s State Ad-ministrative Council. (18) The United States has also implemented new restrictions on exports and reex-ports to Burma pursuant to Executive Order 14014; and (19) On April 24, 2021, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed to a five-point consensus which called for an ‘‘immediate cessation of violence’’, ‘‘con-structive dialogue among all parties’’, the appointment of an ASEAN special envoy, the provision of humanitarian assistance through ASEAN’s AHA Centre, and a visit by the ASEAN special envoy to Burma. Except for the appointment of the Special Envoy in August 2021, the other elements of the ASEAN consensus remain unimplemented due to obstruction by the Burmese military. (20) On March 21, 2022, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the United States had concluded that ‘‘members of the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingya’’. SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

      "Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2022, which I have introduced, along-side Representative STEVE CHABOT , the ranking member of the Asia, the Pa-cific, Central Asia, and Nonprolifera-tion Subcommittee, who I want to thank for working in a bipartisan way. I also want to thank Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member MICHAEL  MCCAUL for working with me in a bipartisan way on this very important and very timely bill. Mr. Speaker, democracy is under severe strain across the globe, and the current crisis in Burma is a stark re-minder of this challenge. It has been just over a year since the Burmese military staged an illegal and illegitimate coup d’etat, seizing con-trol of the Union Government and de-taining a broad cross section of demo-cratically elected civilian leaders. As the military upended Burma’s fragile transition to democracy, it began a widespread suppression of fundamental freedoms. Over the past 14 months, the military’s brutal and senseless violence has resulted in more than 1,700 people killed, including over 100 children. Thousands have been unjustly de-tained, and nearly half a million people have been displaced by the military’s violence. Congress cannot, cannot and must not, stand idly by as the military bru-tally kills its people. As the war in Ukraine has reminded us, America must stand up with freedom-loving people everywhere. The Burmese people have courageously resisted the military’s repres-sion and violence. They have organized a civil disobedience movement to erode the military’s ability to govern. A shadow government, the National Unity Government, has emerged to re-store democratic civilian rule. All they are asking of us is that the world come to their aid and their cause. The Biden administration has taken critical steps to stand with the Bur-mese people, and I want to commend Secretary Blinken’s formal determina-tion last month that the Burmese mili-tary committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Rohingyas, something that was long, long overdue, and which I advocated for in this cur-rent bill. But now it is Congress’ turn to act. The important resolutions, statements of condemnation, and letters of soli-darity this body has sent over the past 14 months are important, but not suffi-cient. The people of Burma need us to do more. Frankly, the Burmese mili-tary’s gross abuses demand that we do more. H.R. 5497 is a comprehensive, bipartisan bill that holds the Burmese mili-tary accountable through targeted sanctions, puts pressure on the junta by urging greater action at the United Nations, and calling for a Special Coor-dinator for Burmese Democracy. It authorizes humanitarian assistance for the hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens that have been inter-nally displaced or fled across the bor-der. It calls on the State Department to document the genocide and the crimes against humanity committed against Rohingyas and other Burmese ethnic minorities. The same military leaders which perpetuated a genocide against Rohingya are now using the same tactics to un-leash unprecedented bloodshed across the entire country. We must end the impunity of the Burmese military and make it harder for it to enact its bru-tality. And to every member of the Burmese ruling elite that does not support the pathway taken by General Min Aung Hlaing, let me say to you loud and clear: Now is the time for you to think about your country’s future and defect, defect, because the Burmese people and the international community will re-member which side you stood on. The economic and diplomatic pressure that this bill applies is essential to changing the junta’s calculus and forcing it to the negotiating table. By passing this legislation, we will take a meaningful step, not just to stand up with the Burmese people, but also to help bring this crisis to an end. Therefore, before this bill becomes law, I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan way to refine the sanctions in this bill so that they remain relevant and effective. Thus, I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can move it one step closer to the President’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES , Washington, DC, April 5, 2022. Hon. G REGORY MEEKS , Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : I am writing concerning H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2022. In order to permit H.R. 5497 to proceed expedi-tiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill. The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to forego formal consider-ation of H.R. 5497 in light of our mutual un-derstanding that, by foregoing formal con-sideration of H.R. 5497 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legisla-tion, and that our Committee will be appro-priately consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves forward with re-gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-risdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or similar legisla-tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-tion and request your support for any such request. Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during Floor consider-ation of H.R. 5497. Sincerely, MAXINE WATERS , Chairwoman. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Washington, DC, April 5, 2022. Hon. M AXINE WATERS , Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS : I am writing to you concerning H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2022, as amended. I appreciate your will-ingness to work cooperatively on this legis-lation. I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 5497 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I also acknowl-edge that your Committee will be appro-priately consulted and involved as this or similar legislation moves forward, and will support the appointment of Committee on Financial Services conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this legislation. Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your cooperation re-garding the legislation. I look forward to continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, GREGORY W. M EEKS , Chairman. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to represent New York’s 22nd Congressional District, which is home to gen-erations of Burmese refugees, dating back to the first family arriving in the early 2000s, and where nearly 5,000 Bur-mese refugees reside. On February 1 of last year, Burma’s military seized power in a violent coup, ending 5 years of flawed, but prom-ising, democracy, dragging Burma back into a brutal military rule. Over the last year, the world has watched in horror as the military tar-geted innocent Burmese men, women, and children. The latest estimates indi-cate that over 1,700 people have been murdered and more than 13,000 arrested by the junta. In the face of this violence and repression, the resilience of the people of Burma is no less than inspiring. The legislation we are considering today is an important step forward in standing with the people of Burma and holding their perpetrators accountable. The BURMA Act will impose mandatory sanctions on the military regime, as well as entities that continue to support it. While the White House has begun to take steps to reimpose the sanctions regime that the former Democratic ad-ministration prematurely lifted, it is time that the Burmese military is again sanctioned as a matter of law, es-pecially now that the United States  has finally recognized that their crimes against the Rohingya amount to geno-cide. Now, more than ever, I urge all to remain committed to the people of Bur-ma’s quest for democracy, for peace, and freedom, and to oppose this affront to human dignity. I thank Chairman MEEKS and Congressman C HABOT for championing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I don’t think I have any further speakers, so I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, America stands as free people against dictators and despots. It is part of our values, and it is an im-portant signal to the world that the United States stands firm against autocrats, whether in Burma or Russia. Last Friday, China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, showed the world how true this is. He met with his counter-part from the Burmese junta regime and said that the Chinese Communist Party would back the Tatmadaw ‘‘no matter how the situation changes.’’ We are at a critical point in history. Authoritarian regimes like China are partnering with their autocratic allies around the world to make the globe less free; to undermine human dignity and individual freedom; and to oppress those who stand up and have the cour-age to speak out as the Burmese people have. It is sickening, and it is one more reason why this legislation is so time-ly. It is critical that America stands united in supporting the people of Burma and championing their funda-mental human rights in the face of military oppression. I will continue to be a voice for this community as we fight to oppose this affront to the peo-ple of Burma’s dignity and freedom and quest for peace. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this measure. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for the purpose of closing. Mr. Speaker, Congress must do more to address this crisis in Burma, and H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2021, will do just that. It will take concrete steps to hold the Burmese military account-able for its coup and for the perpetra-tion of gross human rights violations and other unspeakable atrocities. This bill, Mr. Speaker, sends a strong and unequivocal message that there are severe consequences for subverting democracy, and that the United States of America stands firmly with the Bur-mese people in their struggle for human rights and their democracy. Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues, all 435 of us, will join me in supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act which is impor-tant legislation to support the courageous people of Burma as they struggle to wrest democ-racy from the hands of their authoritarian mili-tary. On February 1, 2021, after a decade of promising democratic reforms in Burma, the Burmese military (also known as the Tatmadaw) seized control of the civilian gov-ernment, declared a state of emergency, and unlawfully detained State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and many Members of Parliament. In response, the peo-ple of Burma took to the streets to demand the restoration of civilian rule, only to be met with the Tatmadaw’s brutal campaign of re-pression, involving extrajudicial executions, mass arrests and disappearances, and other authoritarian tactics. H.R. 5497 is legislation to hold the Tatmadaw accountable for their human rights abuses by authorizing targeted sanctions against the Burmese military and its affiliated entities. These sanctions will deprive the Tatmadaw of the resources they need to con-tinue their violent suppression of the Burmese people. H.R. 5497 also provides much-needed funds to support pro-democracy civil society groups in Burma and alleviate the severe hu-manitarian crisis caused by the Tatmadaw’s violence and mismanagement of the economy. I’m pleased that this legislation advances many of the goals outlined in H. Res. 896, a resolution I introduced on the one-year anni-versary of the coup to condemn the Burmese military’s human rights abuses. My resolution calls for tough sanctions against the Tatmadaw, robust humanitarian assistance for the Burmese people, and increased efforts to hold the Tatmadaw accountable for atrocities. At a time when democracy is being threatened around the world, it’s imperative that the United States join with the courageous people of Burma who are fighting to restore democ-racy in their country. By passing H.R. 5497, Congress will demonstrate our solidarity with the Burmese people, and I urge all my col-leagues to support this bill and vote yes. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking Member of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee, I rise today in support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act, bipartisan legislation Chairman MEEKS and I introduced last year in response to the coup in Burma. And I want to thank Ranking Member MCCAUL and Ms. T ENNEY  and all those who have supported this legisla-tion on both sides of the aisle. As everyone who follows the situation in Burma knows, on February 1, 2021 the Bur-mese military perpetrated a coup against the civilian government, detained its elected lead-ers and set up a junta. This is by no means the first time the generals have seized power but this time the re-sponse has been different. The people of Burma, in all walks of life have courageously stood up against the military with peaceful pro-tests, mass strikes, and other civil disobe-dience. The military’s response bas been predictable—they initiated a crackdown that con-tinues today. They’ve killed over seventeen hundred people and imprisoned thousands more. This repression has pushed the country into civil war, essentially, as the generals stub-bornly refuse to restore democracy. Let me be clear, this coup is a blatant violation of the rights of the Burmese people. Self- government and self-determination are rights of all people around the world, not a gift from a small handful of elites who pretend to be en-titled to rule over their fellow citizens. The generals cannot simply back out of democracy when it no longer serves their purposes. It’s a right that’s owed to the people of Burma. In response to the coup, Chairman MEEKS  and I introduced this BURMA Act. Briefly re-capping the history of this legislation, in Sep-tember 2017, the Burmese military began a genocidal campaign to permanently drive the Rohingya out of Burma which resulted in over 700,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing from Rakhine State, Burma into neighboring Ban-gladesh. They remain there today without any meaningful hope of returning home. This campaign consisted of widespread, systematic, and premeditated human rights abuses, including barbaric killings, gang rapes, and the burning of around 400 Rohingya vil-lages. According to a partial State Department report on these atrocities, about half of the Rohingya surveyed said they personally wit-nessed a rape while about 80 percent wit-nessed killings and the destruction of villages. In response to these atrocities, Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I wrote the original BURMA Act which would have imposed sanc-tions on the military, and deployed several other tools to address longstanding concerns with Burma. While the legislation passed in the House several times, the Senate failed to take it up. Last year, in response to the coup, Chairman MEEKS and I updated the BURMA Act to provide some measure of accountability for both the genocide in 2017 and this year’s coup, and to reflect the sanctions the Biden Administration has already imposed on the Burmese military. The new version of the leg-islation will levy stronger sanctions against the military, and provide additional assistance to the people of Burma. I would specifically like to point out that this legislation deals specifically with accountability for the crimes committed against the Rohingya, and has for the last several years required the State Department to determine whether this was a genocide. I’m pleased that last month Secretary Blinken took this step, and declared officially and on behalf of the United States what many of us have known for some time that the crimes were indeed a genocide. This decision is one we can all sup-port—and probably one of the few things this Administration has done that I can really get behind. As the coup and its aftermath continue to drag on, we must use this determination to renew focus on the situation in Burma and in-tensify our efforts to see that the Burmese Military comes to terms with the fact that the people have chosen a different path. The BURMA Act would go a long way in that effort, so I would urge my colleagues to support its passage. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5497, ‘‘Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 2021’’ or BURMA Act. The purpose of this bill is to authorize humanitarian assistance and civil society sup-port, promote democracy and human rights, and impose targeted sanctions with respect to human rights abuses in Burma. The legislation condemns the actions taken by the Burmese military during its coup on February 1, 2021 and its aftermath.  The BURMA Act: Authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities who helped stage the February 1 coup d’etat and are responsible for the subsequent repression of fundamental freedoms, human rights abuses, use of indiscriminate violence towards civilians, and other gross atrocities. Prohibits the import of precious and semi- precious gemstones from Burma into the United States. Authorizes a new position at the State Department, a Special Coordinator for Burmese Democracy, to promote an international effort to impose and enforce multilateral sanctions on Burma and coordinate United States Gov-ernment interagency efforts on Burma. Authorizes support to civil society and for humanitarian assistance in Burma, Ban-gladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding region. Calls for the Department of State to make a genocide determination with regard to the per-secution of the Rohingya. Calls for the United States to pressure the United Nations to take more decisive action with regards to Burma. By authorizing targeted sanctions against the Burmese military, the Burmese Administra-tive Council and affiliated entities, the bill holds accountable those responsible for the perpetration of the coup and the ensuing atrocities that have claimed over a thousand lives. It has been a little over a year since the Burmese military staged its illegal and illegit-imate coup, reversing years of reform and Burma’s fragile transition to democracy. The military regime has killed more than 1,728 people since February of 2021, includ-ing around 100 children, and illegally detained more than 13,084 people. The violence toward its own citizens has displaced roughly 400,000 people within the country. This brings the estimated total of internally displaced persons to 776,000 and of refugees and asylum-seekers in neighboring countries to more than 1 million. People in Myanmar desperately need food, clean water and protection to survive. The BURMA Act would address these gaps by funding humanitarian assistance and ad-dressing issues in Myanmar including human rights violations, displacement, and armed conflict. Having previously lived under military rule and authoritarianism for decades, the people of Myanmar responded to the coup with cour-age and resistance. Democracy activists flooded the streets, formed a shadow government, and carried out a massive civil disobedience movement to shut down the machinery of the state. The tragedy underway in Myanmar epitomizes the battle between democracy and authoritarianism. However, the people of Myanmar have not received much support from the international community, in efforts to condemn this coup the United States must act now by expanding targeted sanctions to halt this. The toll on the people of Burma has been truly staggering, under the military’s harsh rule, no one is safe from violence, arbitrary detainment, military attack, and infringements on human rights. I am optimistic that we will pass the BURMA Act to apply economic pressure, provide hu-manitarian support, and redouble diplomatic efforts against the military junta. The people of Burma can no longer afford to wait, so neither should we. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 5497 because these people who have survived crimes against humanity, discrimina-tion, gender-based violence and forced displacement in Myanmar need the humanitarian assistance this bill would provide. \n",

It is the sense of Congress that— (1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine that commenced on February 24, 2022, the military of the Government of the Russian Federation under the direction of President Vladimir Putin has committed war crimes that include but are not limited to— (A) the deliberate targeting of civilians and injuring or killing of noncombatants; (B) the deliberate targeting and attacking of hospitals, schools, and other non-military buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable purposes, such as the bombing of a theater in Mariupol that served as a shelter for noncombatants and had the word ‘‘children’’ written clearly in the Russian language outside; (C) the indiscriminate bombardment of undefended dwellings and buildings; (D) the wanton destruction of property not justified by military necessity; (E) unlawful civilian deportations; (F) the taking of hostages; and (G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse; (2) the use of chemical weapons by the Government of the Russian Federation in Ukraine would constitute a war crime, and engaging in any military preparations to use chemical weapons or to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain chemical weapons is pro-hibited by the Chemical Weapons Conven-tion, to which the Russian Federation is a signatory; (3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of committing acts of aggression, systematic abuses of human rights, and acts that constitute war crimes or other atrocities both at home and abroad, and the brutality and scale of these actions, including in the Rus-sian Federation republic of Chechnya, Geor-gia, Syria, and Ukraine, demonstrate the ex-tent to which his regime is willing to flout international norms and values in the pur-suit of its objectives; (4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanctioned the use of chemical weapons at home and abroad, including in the poisonings of Russian spy turned double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia and leading Russian opposition figure Aleksey Navalny, and aided and abetted the use of chemical weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and (5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian Federation initiated its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine which resulted in its illegal occupation of Crimea, the unrec-ognized declaration of independence by the so-called ‘‘Donetsk People’s Republic’’ and ‘‘Luhansk People’s Republic’’ by Russia- backed proxies, and numerous human rights violations and deaths of civilians in Ukraine. SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

      "Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7276, the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act introduced by my good friend and the ranking member of the House For-eign Affairs Committee, Mr. MCCAUL. I want to thank Mr. M CCAUL for working collectively across the aisle as we do on many bills, but on this impor-tant bill, for his leadership on it. It is very timely and very important. Mr. Speaker, each day we see a growing body of horrifying evidence of atrocities that Russian troops have wreaked on Ukrainian citizens. Mr. MCCAULand I traveled to Poland, and we saw with our own eyes the refugees fleeing Ukraine because of Putin’s war; not knowing whether they would see their husbands or fathers or uncles ever again; not knowing what their to-morrow would be. This week, the images, the videos, and the firsthand accounts from Bucha were nothing short of chilling, and as it did seeing the refugees cross the bor-der in Poland, it pains my heart to know that this is likely just the tip of the iceberg of what Ukrainians have suffered. b1245 In attempting to justify his war of choice on Ukraine, Putin’s relentless dehumanization of Ukrainians has laid the foundation for atrocities so vile it churns one’s stomach. We have seen this before, Mr. Speaker. It is the same dehumanization that has led to every genocide before. I fear what we have seen in Bucha is hap-pening throughout Ukraine right now, and it will only get worse. Nothing we do on this floor today will erase the generational trauma that Putin’s forces have inflicted on Ukrainians, but we can and must en-sure that the United States of America is doing everything in its power to col-lect evidence that can be used to pros-ecute Russian war crimes and other atrocities. Hopefully, that will deter further systemic human rights abuses in this conflict. H.R. 7276 would require the administration to detail efforts to collect, ana-lyze, and preserve evidence of war crimes, and to describe the process through which a domestic, foreign, or international court or tribunal could request and obtain information related to war crimes or other atrocities from the United States. Every day of this illegal and unprovoked war further unites the global community against Russia’s ag-gression in Ukraine. The images that we continue to see day in and day out are shocking to the conscience and also a call to action. To the leaders of the nations who have yet to condemn this barbaric war of choice, I ask them to please watch these videos of civilians being bombed and, as we did both in Poland and with those who visited us here in the House of Representatives, listen to the sur-vivors who witnessed their neighbors and their friends shot in the streets or in their homes, some bound with their hands behind their backs. The camera of history is rolling, Mr. Speaker, and it will remember those countries that remain silent. Russia’s aggression in Ukraine must stop. We must unequivocally condemn the atrocities that are being carried out by Putin and his Russian invading forces. Those who are responsible, Mr. Speaker, must be brought to justice, no matter how long it takes or how hard it may be. The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act will help in collecting the necessary evi-dence so that we can do just that: Hold those individuals accountable for the atrocities that they have committed. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join and support this crucial legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Chairman M EEKS , for working with me on this important legislation. This is a historic time, and it is a historic bill. This is the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, with war crimes in Europe the likes of which we haven’t seen since my father’s generation in my father’s war. Mr. Speaker, the world is watching, and history will judge us all by how we act, by our actions. As the chairman said, the tape is filming; the reel is filming this. We are seeing these hor-rific images coming out of Ukraine as I speak, and sadly, there will be many more. We have just hit the surface. Corpses are littering the streets of Bucha, their hands tied behind their backs and bullets in their heads. Some are decapitated. A pregnant woman, covered in blood—these monsters bombed a ma-ternity hospital, for God’s sake—as she gets wheeled out, holding on to her womb or baby. Sadly, and tragically, both she and her baby did not survive that day. Mothers are raped in front of their children, and young girls are raped in front of their families—girls. The bodies of families are half-buried together in shallow graves, with their hands still sticking out of the ground. My God, what is happening in this world? I never imagined or thought I would see this in my lifetime. This is of centuries ago, not today. The bombing of apartments and public buildings providing refuge to chil-dren and the elderly, including a the-ater in Mariupol that had the word ‘‘children’’ written outside so large in Russian that the satellites could see it—we could see it from satellites. What do the Russians do? They bombed it. They bombed it knowing that there were children inside. Today, just today, most disturbing, we have reporting out of Ukraine that Russia is bringing in mobile crematoriums to deal with the carnage because there are so many bodies in the streets. They are bringing in mo-bile crematoriums in an effort to hide the evidence of their crimes. These are Putin’s war crimes, and he will be held responsible. He and his cro-nies, and the Russian troops who have carried them out, must be held ac-countable. Sadly, these are not the first war crimes committed by Putin’s troops, as the people of Chechnya, Georgia, and Syria can attest. We cannot wait for the next atrocity before we act. We must do what we can now to deter Russian leaders, com-manders, and troops in the field from committing further war crimes. That is why we introduced this legislation. It will ensure the United States helps the people of Ukraine gather, analyze, and maintain the evidence of these war crimes. It will also put Russian troops—I think ‘‘troops’’ is probably not the right word—these Russian monsters and their leaders on notice that the world is watching. The world is watching them right now, and we are taking names. We are  taking the names of these war criminals; we are taking photographs; we are taking surveillance; and we are taking the satellite imagery to docu-ment this injustice, this crime against humanity. And we will seek justice. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the bipartisan efforts that our committee has made. But on the topic, I just have to—my God, I can’t believe we are here even talking about this. I can’t believe this is actually happening in this world, in this century. These horrific atrocities in Bucha have made one thing crystal clear: No country can remain neutral in the face of this evil. The entire world needs to rally against Mr. Putin and these war crimes. Passing this bill is a step for-ward to getting justice done. I was a Federal prosecutor for a good part of my life, and I have dealt with a lot of victims. I have seen a lot of real-ly awful things that man can do to mankind. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, this is probably—in fact, it is abso-lutely the worst thing I have seen in my lifetime. The world is watching, and history will judge us all. All nations will judge us all by what we do here and now. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the leadership of our chair-man and the working relationship with the ranking member. Mr. Speaker, I was in Lithuania as the Russians were coming in, and I spent a couple of days there with the hopes and dreams of many people that, in actuality, there would not be an in-vasion of Russia into Ukraine, even though we were being briefed on the 30,000 to 40,000 troops in Belarus. Even on that day, we spoke to Ukraine parliamentarians, who indi-cated that they were leaving the meet-ing we were in and taking a 17-hour trip back to Ukraine as their son was standing up to join the Ukrainian mili-tary. Little did we expect—as some people said, ‘‘just a couple of days’’—that we would be at a point where—we will not call it World War III, but we will call it the most brutal, vicious, and mur-derous effort in Europe and the world almost since World War II. I cannot fathom the bodies found in a pit. I cannot understand moms and ba-bies dying in the street. I cannot un-derstand or accept the numbers of ci-vilians targeted, their bodies strewn throughout the various cities. The movement to the east, the destruction of Odessa, and the unwilling-ness of Vladimir Putin to even think of being serious at the peace table—it is important to say pronounced war crimes have been committed, that he must be at The Hague. I believe Europe should be more pronounced in its annunciation. I frankly believe that there is a heavier penalty that he must pay. I don’t believe he should sit at another table of Western civilization. Most importantly, I rise to support this legislation and believe America is right to insist on Mr. Putin being tried for war crimes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7276 the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, to direct the President to submit a report to Congress on the United States efforts to collect and analyze evidence and information related to the war crimes committed by the Russian Federation during their full-scale inva-sion of Ukraine. This legislation requires the Administration to detail the process our government will un-dertake to collect, analyze, and preserve evi-dence of these war crimes, so that perpetra-tors of these and other atrocities are held ac-countable. There is no question of whether the Russian Federation, under the direction of Vladimir Putin has been defying the laws of war throughout its unprovoked, unjust, and unlaw-ful invasion of Ukraine. H.R. 7276 will ensure the U.S. maintains a coordinated effort to collect evidence to be used to prosecute Russian war crimes in Ukraine. This bill will help to deter future war crimes by ensuring Russian troops and their com-manders know the world is watching closely. In the three decades since gaining its independence, Ukraine has sought its own path to sovereignty and has pursued closer economic, social, and political ties with the free market and democratic nations of the West. Since 2013, the Russian Federation under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, has imposed a campaign of political, economic, and military aggression against Ukraine. In February 2014, the Russian military began the invasion of eastern regions in Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula. The military also backed separatist insurgents in the Donbass region, where fighting has killed over 14,000 people. Today the world is witnessing the unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered by Vladimir Putin. President Putin and his associates must be held personally liable for the war crimes com-mitted against the people of Ukraine. Russia claims it is not attacking civilians, yet thousands of people have been killed, mostly from explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. Families are being separated by war, adults and children are being ruthlessly killed, and ci-vilian infrastructure has been completely oblit-erated in parts of eastern Ukraine. These reckless Russian attacks have leveled homes, preschools, post offices, muse-ums, sports facilities, hospitals, and factories. Power and gas lines have been severed, bridges and railway stations blown up inten-tionally to restrict refugee movement within the country. Civilians have been killed in their cars, while waiting in bread lines, and while seeking treat-ment in hospitals. Remnants of a missile were found in a Ukrainian zoo, residential neighborhoods have been shelled to pieces and morgues are over-flowing with bodies. Additionally, a rogue Russia is violently crushing political speech opposing the war from its own citizens. As Russian ground forces advance in Ukraine, Ukrainians are sheltering from artil-lery shells and cruise missiles in subways and bomb shelters. But in addition to the conventional military forces that Russia brings to bear, Russia has been utilizing nonconventional warfare for years. Russia has been running a long-running campaign to cast Ukrainians as Nazis and the perpetrators of genocide against Russian- speakers in eastern Ukraine in order to justify an invasion. The western world must continue to march in lockstep against this senseless Russian in-vasion of a sovereign nation. We will make it clear to President Putin that there is no possibility for him to win this war when our alliances are as united and as for-tified as they are now and will continue to be throughout the entire duration of this conflict. Putin may seize ground, but he will never hold it. Thank you, and I look forward to discussing recommended measures to hold Russia ac-countable for this manufactured war. b1300 Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-sas (Mr. HILL). Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7276, the Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deter-rence and Accountability Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this important legislation, and I thank Chairman MEEKS and the committee for working with Ranking Member M CCAULon this critical, bipartisan bill. Last weekend, the world saw in Bucha what the Ukrainian people have been telling us since the start of this invasion, that the Russians are indis-criminately torturing and executing Ukrainian men, women, and children. It is important in these periods of conflict that the United States con-tribute to collecting, analyzing, and preserving critical evidence of war crimes and other atrocities. For two decades Putin has gone unchecked and never paid a diplomatic or even economic price for his 22 years of mania. He has never faced, until he met the Ukrainians, true armed resist-ance. He leveled Grozny, destroyed his-toric Aleppo with his coconspirator and partner, Assad, and he waltzed into Crimea, Mr. Speaker, in 2014 without firing a shot. The line has been finally drawn in Ukraine. This House, on a bipartisan basis, has worked to document Assad’s mass mur-der in Syria. As a result of that work and the work of the United Nations Mechanism, we have had a recent con-viction in Koblenz, Germany, of a Syr-ian intelligence official for crimes against humanity. The U.N. recently approved an independent inquiry into Ukraine. That is precisely the same step of a decade ago in Syria. Enacting this legislation will ensure that the United States contrib-utes to this effort.  I encourage all my colleagues to support this important bill, and I thank Mr. MEEKS and Mr. M CCAUL for their leadership. Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time at this mo-ment, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding, and I thank both Ranking Member MCCAULand Chairman M EEKS  for their extraordinary leadership on this important bill that is before us today. I want to thank Mr. MEEKS for his eloquent remarks a moment ago summa-rizing the absolute atrocities that are being committed by Vladimir Putin, his military, and Lukashenko who is the enabler, the President of Belarus. The gentleman has described in vivid detail just how horrific this is. And as my good friend from Texas said a mo-ment ago, my father fought in World War II as well in the South Pacific, but the crimes that were committed by im-perial Japan and by the Nazis are now being replicated on a grand scale by Vladimir Putin. It has to stop, and it has to stop yesterday. So I rise in strong support of this legislation. Madam Speaker, on March 8 I chaired a hearing at the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission entitled ‘‘Account-ability for Russia’s War Crimes and Ag-gression Against Ukraine.’’ The day be-fore I also introduced a resolution call-ing for accountability for Vladimir Putin for his crimes against the Ukrainian people and his aggression against Ukraine. The witnesses could not have been more clear that delay is denial and that we need to act now. I was very much involved with the court in the former Yugoslavia and very involved with the court for Sierra Leone. David Crane led that effort. I was very involved with the Rwandan court and tried to get a court for Syria but failed. I pushed hard for it with a resolution on this floor, and the House did pass it. But the key here is timeliness. Don’t wait. The ICC, while it may do some good here, and they do have an investigation that they have instituted, the ICC has been notoriously slow. They have had less than 10 convictions over 20 years. Now, if that venue works, great. But my concern—and I think the concern shared by many, particularly in the NGO community—is that there needs to be another venue stood up quickly that could make the difference. At the March hearing, David Crane, the founding Chief Prosecutor of the U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone, talked about an international tribunal created by the United Nations General Assembly. We are all thinking, Hey, when it gets to the Security Council, the Security Council will have two ve-toes at least. It will be Russia, and it will be China. Not so in the General As-sembly. They can stand up a court and they can do it tomorrow that would in-dict Vladimir Putin on the next day. There is certainly enough evidence— keep building the evidence, of course— but there is enough evidence to do it right now, and that, hopefully, will tell everybody around him that the time will come when you will be in the dock as well. I remember meeting with Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia and going to Bos-nia and Croatia many times during that horrific war in the Balkans. Time and time again he thought he was un-touchable, total impunity because of that. He killed so many because there was no accountability. Well, he went to The Hague as part of the ad hoc tri-bunal, and he died while the pro-ceedings were underway. But he would have been held to account. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this. We have al-ready had one vote in the General As-sembly, 141 out of 198 voted and a num-ber of people abstained. You only need a simple majority. I did ask our number two at the State Department, at GREGORY MEEKS ’ hearing earlier today, to take back to the administration the idea of looking at all the venues. But let’s get a court constituted immediately. If the ICC wants to step in at some point, fine. But indict Putin. Indict him, and you will see some people running like rats on the ship who were a part of his re-gime knowing that they, too, will be held accountable and sent to prison for the rest of their lives. Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing. Madam Speaker, we rise today not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans and as a united Congress on behalf of the American people con-demning these atrocities. Madam Speaker, there is a group called the Wagner Group that is enter-ing Ukraine right now. They are the worst of the worst. They are merce-naries. They are cold-blooded killers. Mr. Putin has sent them to Africa to kill people in Mali and Libya, and they have been in the Donbas previously. They have a saying, these Wagner thugs, these monsters, that our busi-ness is killing, and business is good. This is sick. They rape women and girls. They kill for a living, and, yes, now they are entering Ukraine. Sadly, Madam Speaker, I am not sure Bucha is the last we are going to see of this, and when the dust clears from Mariupol, God knows what we are going to find there. God only knows. When they are talking about mobile crematoriums to hide the evidence of so much carnage and so many bodies to be burned. This has to stop. We are standing together united as Americans condemning this, and as a former Federal prosecutor, yes, to indict Mr. Putin for his crimes against humanity. Mr. Putin thought his legacy after this fiasco was going to be reclaiming the glory of the empire. He would be known as great as the czars or maybe Stalin. Maybe he is like Stalin. His leg-acy is not going to be reclaiming the empire. His legacy is going to be that of a war criminal. That will impact his psyche, and that will impact all those around him, including his oligarchs, that no one is safe here, that you will be indicted internationally, and that you will be brought to justice. For without justice in the face of these crimes against humanity, what good are we? So this is an historic mo-ment. I want to thank the chairman, as always, on this committee for working with me to stand up against evil, be-cause that is exactly what this is. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing. Madam Speaker, what we are witnessing Russian troops do in Ukraine represents some of the worst of human-kind. Right now, the world is watching horrifying war crimes taking place. The world is watching the extent to which Putin is willing to flout inter-national norms and values in the pur-suit of its brutality, and the world is also watching what we as a nation are going to do about it. The Department of State has officially concluded that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine which were made vividly clear by the horrifying images emerging over this past weekend from Bucha. Investiga-tions into these war crimes are already beginning and must continue. I am saying today, as chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee working along with my friend and part-ner, the ranking member, MIKE MCCAUL, we will work tirelessly to make sure that justice is delivered and that the administration works strenu-ously in concert with partners and al-lies to this end because meaningful jus-tice for these crimes helps prevent such atrocities in the future. This legislation requires the administration to detail efforts to preserve evi-dence and hold perpetrators account-able for the atrocities that are com-mitted and to detail the means for do-mestic, hybrid, or international courts and their tribunals to request access to such information. This legislation, the Ukrainian Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Ac-countability Act, will ensure that vic-tims and perpetrators alike know that the United States of America and the world, we have got to get those off the seat, those who abstain in the U.N., they see the same thing. We need them to stand and have a voice. The world is watching. The world will hold Putin and the Russian Armed  Forces and those who are in their duma and those who keep pushing this war that is caused by one man, Vladimir Putin—these abhorrent war crimes which continue to go on—accountable. It is a war of choice that Putin has de-cided to place on Ukraine. That is why, Madam Speaker, I am so proud to partner with MIKEMCCAULin bringing H.R. 7276 to the floor today so that my children, my grandchildren, my great-great-grandchildren, will know how I stood at this time in his-tory and how the United States Con-gress stood at this time in history. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. \n",

      "Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 1023. The rule pro-vides for consideration of the resolu-tion accompanying House Report 117– 284 under a closed rule if the report is called up by direction of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Cap-itol. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by Chairman THOMPSON , Vice Chair CHENEY , and an opponent. Mr. Speaker, if 90 percent of success in life is just showing up, then 90 per-cent of acting in contempt of Congress is not showing up by failing to respond to multiple subpoenas you have been lawfully served. The rest of contempt is not turning over documents you have been ordered to produce and act-ing with open disregard and scorn for the rule of law, Congress, and rep-resentatives of the American people. Neither Dan Scavino nor Peter Navarro has shown up in response to repeated congressional subpoenas. They have blown us off completely. Neither Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro has produced a single document or of-fered 1 minute of testimony in response to the subpoenas sent by the House of Representatives. While more than 800 Americans have come forward voluntarily or properly responded to congressional subpoenas, which are orders under penalty of law, saying you must show up to testify under oath and invoke any asserted privileges in person, Scavino and Navarro have followed Steve Bannon and are acting as if they are way too busy and way too important to bother with the mere United States House of Representatives. They think that hav-ing worked for a former President of the United States excuses them from complying with lawful orders. This is clearly false; this is clearly wrong; and we must make an emphatic statement about it today. Mr. Speaker, I ask America to consider this: If your son or daughter were subpoenaed to come testify before the Congress of the United States, would you advise them to sit home on the couch and blow it off? I know I wouldn’t. Every year, thousands of Americans are held in criminal contempt for ig-noring their legal obligations to com-ply with a lawful subpoena issued by courts or legislative bodies. Here in the District of Columbia, you can be sent to jail for 6 months and fined $1,000 for acting in contempt of a subpoena and not showing up. We have checked on multiple days and found, on any given day, 7, 8, 10, or a dozen peo-ple are being found guilty of contempt in the courts of the District of Colum-bia. That is the exact same criminal offense that Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro committed, and that is the exact same penalty they are facing for their misconduct. Each of these witnesses was given ample and repeated opportunities to comply, opportunities that continue to this day. Yet, they openly and brazenly flout the authority of the Congress and mock their own personal duty to com-ply with the rule of law. Legal contempt exists for those who act with open disregard or disobedience of the law, especially when acting with scorn for the authority of government. It exists precisely for cases like this. Here is what has happened with Mr. Scavino. In September of last year, the committee issued its first of three sub-poenas. We asked him to come testify before us on October 15, 2021, last year. When he could not be found to actually accept service of the first sub-poena, we issued a second subpoena, asking him to appear before the com-mittee on October 28, 2021. He told the committee that wasn’t enough time for him; he needed 1 extra week. We generously gave him a week, and we set a third deposition date of No-vember 4, 2021, but he didn’t come on November 4 either. Instead, he re-quested another extension. Bending over backward to accommodate this witness, we set a fourth depo-sition date of November 12, 2021. Still, that wasn’t enough time for him. We acted in good faith again, and assuming he was acting in good faith, we set a fifth deposition date of November 19. When that day arrived, did he fi-nally show up to do his civic duty? No, he did not. Instead, he waited until the eve of the deposition and then, for the first time, challenged the service of the subpoena. Out of an abundance of deference and caution, and to make every effort to demonstrate the respect for the rule of law that Scavino was not showing, we issued yet a third subpoena inviting him to come testify before us once again on December 1, 2021. Finally, with Scavino completely out of excuses and the committee out of patience, his final deposition date of December 1 arrived, and he simply did not show up. Six times this committee invited Scavino to testify, and six times he stood us up. He stood the American people up. He refused to testify before Congress about what he knows about the most dangerous and sweeping as-sault on the United States Congress since the War of 1812, which was by a foreign power. But even after he failed to show up in December, the committee held an open door for Mr. Scavino to come in and  testify. But in the more than 6 months since the committee’s first subpoena was sent to him, he has never once come in to speak with us. He has not given us a single document, Mr. Speak-er. It is the same basic story with Mr. Navarro. On February 9, we issued him a subpoena to produce documents on February 23 and to testify on March 2. There have been repeated evasions and contortions by the witness since then. Generous accommodations have been offered by the committee, all of it lead-ing to nothing but his open contempt and mockery for this process and for the rule of law. He never showed up, and he never produced a single docu-ment. When more than 800 Americans have voluntarily testified and complied with the subpoenas rendered by our com-mittee, the witnesses have nothing but excuses for their noncompliance, ex-cuses you would not accept from a teenage child. Navarro says he wants us to send him written interrogatories, and he will an-swer his questions in writing. Wouldn’t that be nice? Any witness to a car acci-dent, a murder, an assault, or an insur-rection in the land would love not to have to answer actual questions under sworn oath, but that is not how our system works. The word ‘‘subpoena’’ means ‘‘under the penalty of law.’’ ‘‘Sub’’ means under; ‘‘poena’’ means ‘‘penalty of law.’’ Under the penalty of law, you show up and you answer questions in the United States of America. If you think you have a legal privilege excus-ing you from answering questions, you assert your privileges under oath, at the time of questioning that you show up, to specific questions, whether it is the attorney-client privilege; the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-in-crimination, which a number of wit-nesses have asserted before our com-mittee, as it is their legal right to do; the priest-penitent privilege; or the ex-ecutive privilege. The Court has been clear. The Supreme Court has been clear. If you think you have one of these privileges, you show up and you assert it to the specific questions being asked to you. But the privilege against self-incrimi-nation, the executive privilege, the marital privilege, none of these is a magic wand that you can wave from your sofa and not show up under a sub-poena to a lawful proceeding. But Navarro continues to mutter the words ‘‘executive privilege,’’ as if it is some kind of magic wand that would keep him from ever having to testify about anything, like Harry Potter’s in-visibility cloak. He even says, repeat-edly, the executive privilege is not mine to waive, which is high comedy, Mr. Speaker, because it is not his to waive, which means, by definition, it is not his to invoke in the first place. We know it is not his to invoke. The Supreme Court has been clear about this, too. The executive privilege be-longs to the President of the United States of America, the actual Presi-dent. President Biden has specifically decided not to invoke executive privi-lege in Navarro’s case or in Scavino’s case. Yet, Navarro says the executive privilege here belongs to ex-President Donald Trump, which is not only ex-tremely dubious but totally irrelevant. It is dubious because the Supreme Court just rejected a claim by Donald Trump himself, in Trump v. Thompson, that his materials were protected from disclosure to the January 6th Select Committee in Congress by executive privilege. Even if Trump were still the President, the Court essentially said there is an overwhelming public interest in these materials that dwarfs whatever dubious interest in executive secrecy may linger. So the claim would fail, even if President Joe Biden were him-self here to assert it on behalf of Navarro and Scavino. But Navarro’s attempt to stand above the law by mentioning Donald Trump’s name is also completely irrel-evant. Why? Everyone, please take note of this: Because Donald Trump has never even asserted the executive privilege to cover Peter Navarro, not once. We have received no communica-tion from Donald Trump, either di-rectly or indirectly from Navarro, showing that Trump is trying to exer-cise an executive privilege claim, which is doomed to failure anyway under the logic of the decision just ren-dered by the Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, so what do we have? Two guys in the District of Columbia blowing off a congressional investiga-tion and subpoenas into a deadly insur-rection, which caused multiple deaths; inflicted brutal, savage injuries on 150 of our officers, who ended up with bro-ken jaws, necks, vertebrae, noses, trau-matic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress syndrome; and interrupted Con-gress from executing its constitutional duties of counting electoral college votes for the very first time in Amer-ican history—oh, yes. And it nearly succeeded in overthrowing the 2020 Presidential election and toppling the peaceful transfer of power, perhaps for all time, as United States District Court Judge Carter wrote in a blis-tering opinion last week, rejecting this exact same and equally ridiculous claim of John Eastman, who helped cook up the absurd legal camouflage for this attempted coup in the first place against the American constitu-tional system of government. The gentlewoman, I think, said something about the Russian hoax or Rus-sian collusion. I accept the heckling, Mr. Speaker. That is all right because if she wants to continue to stand with Vladimir Putin and his brutal, bloody invasion against the people of Ukraine, she is free to do so. We understand there is a strong Trump-Putin axis in the gentle-woman’s party. If she wants to con-tinue to stand with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, that is her prerogative, but please do it on her own time forth-with. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1330 Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mary-land for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of a resolu-tion holding Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino in contempt of Congress. From the very beginning, the select committee has been nothing more than a partisan tool used by House Demo-crats to attack their political oppo-nents. Time and time again, they have run roughshod over our Constitution and they have run roughshod over the very rules of this institution. And to what end? To advance their own polit-ical agenda. We need look no further than the resolution establishing the committee to see their complete disregard for this Chamber. House Resolution 503 states the Speaker shall appoint 13 members, five of whom shall be appointed after consultation with minority leaders. Neither of those ‘‘shall’’ clauses have been met. While this may seem insignificant to my colleagues across the aisle, it is certainly of consequence to the courts. Let’s talk about some case law. Yellin v. United States. There the Court reversed the conviction of con-tempt of Congress because a congres-sional committee failed to adhere to its own rules. The Court explained, ‘‘The committee prepared the ground-work for prosecution in Yellin’s case meticulously.’’ Yet, ‘‘It is not too ex-acting to require that the committee be equally meticulous in obeying its own rules.’’ I suggest to my Demo-cratic colleagues, heed those words. As a former Navy JAG, I am deeply troubled by the committee’s treatment of Mr. Scavino, including clear due process violations. The select com-mittee repeatedly demanded almost immediate responses from Mr. Scavino, while waiting for weeks—weeks—to provide responses to his correspond-ence. Further, the select committee has shown complete disregard for Mr. Scavino’s legal duty, his legal duty to invoke the executive privilege, which he was instructed to do by President Trump. There is no legal authority that the incumbent President is the final arbiter as to whether executive privilege may be asserted for congres-sional testimony of close aides to a former President. The Presidential Records Act applies only to Presidential records within control of the National Archives. That is it. It is a very narrow statute. That act does not control whether testimony can be given.  Let’s talk about some more case law. United States v. Nixon. The Supreme Court held in that case, ‘‘Communica-tions between a President and his clos-est aides are entitled to a presumption of privilege of confidentiality which can be overcome only by a particular-ized showing of a need in a criminal case.’’ I want to emphasize criminal case. This is not a criminal case. Finally, the select committee initially provided Mr. Scavino with 15 topics which they wanted to discuss. That list later grew to 33. The select committee then went so far as to place the onus on Mr. Scavino, saying that it is his responsibility to ‘‘identify the specific topics outside the scope of his asserted privilege.’’ As I am sure my friend across the aisle knows, and any lawyer on the other side of the aisle knows, the bur-den is not on the subject of the deposi-tion to identify the topics on which they can be questioned. The Supreme Court found—and here is some more case law—in Watkins v. United States, the Supreme Court found in that case, ‘‘ . . . a person compelled to testify is entitled to have knowledge of the sub-ject to which the interrogation is deemed pertinent. . . . ‘’ If the select committee wanted to conduct a legitimate investigation, they would not be rushing to hold Mr. Scavino in contempt after imposing unreasonable and unattainable timelines, ignoring legitimate asser-tions of a privilege, and then refusing legitimate accommodations. It is clear the resolution before us today is not about a witness’ refusal to testify or refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena. This is all about Democrats’ need to further their partisan agenda. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is not a partisan investigation. We were created under House Resolu-tion 503 after, I am afraid, the gen-tleman and his colleagues voted to thwart a totally bipartisan, inde-pendent outside commission made up of five Democrats and five Republicans with equal subpoena power simply be-cause Donald Trump exercised his veto within the Republican Party; the same Donald Trump who calls the madman, mass murderer, Vladimir Putin, a ge-nius, but we know we have some people echoing all of Trump’s complicity with Vladimir Putin from the Georgia dele-gation back there. This is a bipartisan committee. It is the only committee I am aware of that has a Democratic chair in a Demo-cratic-controlled House of Representa-tives and a Republican vice chair, Ms. CHENEY , who was the head of the GOP Conference. She was the head of the House Republican Conference, now the vice chair of this committee, and they call it a partisan exercise. The second point I need to make is that executive privilege must be as-serted by the President. This one isn’t even asserted by the former President. It is just somebody going in and say-ing, ‘‘I have got an executive privi-lege.’’ Is that really the precedent that my colleagues want to set, Madam Speak-er? I mean, that is pretty astonishing if that is the position that they are tak-ing. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON ), my very distinguished colleague. Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, it has been said before, but ours is a country of laws, not men, and in our democratic Republic, the voters choose who leads, not a dictator, and not a monarch. But in the wake of the 2020 election, a small group of people decided to re-ject the rule of law and the will of the voters. They rejected the unanimous conclusion of the courts, the Depart-ment of Justice, Homeland Security, and law enforcement and election offi-cials across the country. They tried to pervert the law and throw away the free choice of the people. On January 6, their plan almost worked. As the select committee investigates what happened that day, and how it can be prevented from ever happening again, over 800 witnesses have come in to share what they know because that is what should happen in a country ruled by law. Only a handful of people, all of them in the former President’s inner circle, have refused to obey the subpoenas. Their baseless claims that they are im-mune have been rejected by the actual President, by Congress, and by the courts. These entitled few have refused to honor Congress’ subpoenas, just like they rejected the results of the elec-tion, because they believe they are above the law. They are not. That is why it is so important that we pass this rule and the underlying bill and hold those in defiance of these subpoenas in contempt, because their conduct is not just unlawful and unpa-triotic, it is contemptible. Our Constitution, not any person, is what makes our country great. Nobody is above the law, and certainly nobody is above the Constitution. Madam Speaker, I strongly support the rule and its underlying legislation, and I urge all my colleagues who truly love the country more than performative antics to do the same. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My good friend from Maryland was talking about some case law. I will talk case law all day. Here are three real fast: Quinn v. United States. The Supreme Court said that Congress cannot issue a subpoena for law enforcement purpose. Watkins v. United States. Congress has no authority to issue a subpoena to compel exposure for the sake of exposure. McGrain v. Daugherty. Congress may not issue a subpoena in an attempt to try someone before a committee for any crime of wrongdoing. I have ample case law up here that will show, at the very best, for my friends across the aisle that case law is unsettled, but it is very likely on the side of Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request. Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden’s border cri-sis. \n",

Let me be clear: the riot on January 6 was wrong. Any violence on that day should be punished, as I have said be-fore. But make no mistake: the Democrats’ response is also wrong. For 15 months, Democrats have used January 6 as a blank check to trample on civil rights and congressional norms. They broke every rule, violated every norm, bullied every skeptic simply to hold on to power. Let’s be honest: this is a political show trial. The committee has sent hundreds of subpoenas to private citizens for phone records, bank records, and private com-munications. To those who invoked their right to due process, Chairman THOMPSON replied, ‘‘ . . . you are part and parcel guilty to what occurred.’’ What a disgusting betrayal of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But think for a second about what Chairman THOMPSON is saying. If you question his authority, if you disobey his demands, then you are a criminal and you should be punished. Congresswoman LURIA, who is also on the select committee agrees. Last week, she criticized Attorney General Garland for not putting her political opponents in jail fast enough. She told Garland, ‘‘ . . . do your job so we can do ours.’’ I am sure some Members got real excited by that. Democrats are using the power of the Federal Government to jail their polit-ical opponents and threatening the At-torney General for not doing it fast enough. In their twisted view, this agreement is immoral. Dissent is a crime. And they are to be obeyed without ques-tion. Today’s resolution is also about criminalizing dissent. I can pause, Mr. Speaker, if he needs to listen more. Mr. RASKIN. I am sorry? Mr. MCCARTHY. I was going to tell Mr. Speaker if the House is not in order, and you need to listen to staff, I can pause. Mr. RASKIN. Are you yielding? Mr. MCCARTHY. No. I said to Mr. Speaker, the House is not in order.  There was no yielding. Your staff is continuing to communicate. I think if I am speaking, the House should be in order. I don’t know if that is a criminal offense, too. Mr. RASKIN. You have not been heckled by any of our Members, while I was heckled by—— Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have the time. You have the gavel. \n",

      "Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, today’s resolution is about criminalizing dissent. Democrats are threatening to throw in jail a good man who has done noth-ing but attempt to follow the law sim-ply because he is President Trump’s closest aid. Mr. Scavino does not deserve that. He tried to cooperate with the select committee’s requests. He sent timely letters to the committee to clarify the vague scope of the requested testi-mony. He even offered to answer the committee’s questions in writing, which the committee’s rules allow for, so he could balance cooperation with fair concerns about executive privilege. But the committee rejected every compromise. It is their way or no way. It took them 2 months to reply to Mr. Scavino’s letter, then another 6 weeks. Then they rushed to hold him in contempt. They also demanded the right to ask any question they wanted, including on topics that have nothing to do with protecting the Capitol, like the 25th Amendment. Even if you agree that the select committee has a legislative purpose, the fact is that purpose is not unlim-ited. The committee must identify a specific nexus between its legislative pur-pose and the information it wants. But it never identified the nexus for the in-formation it was seeking from Mr. Scavino. And I bet it won’t identify that nexus today either. Why? Because the nexus does not exist. Without it, their subpoena is invalid. Congressional oversight is supposed to inform the legislative process and must have a valid legislative purpose. It is not there so the swamp can bully its political enemies. Let’s be honest. Mr. Scavino never acted like he was above the law, and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. If anyone has acted like they are above the law, it is the Select Committee. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, two wrongs don’t make a right. The riot on January 6 was wrong, but Democrats’ reaction to trample Amer-ican civil liberties is also wrong. Do we really want to live in a country where politicians can seize your phone records, compel your testimony, and ignore your rights because they disagree with your politics? Most Americans don’t want to live in a country like that. That happens in Russia, in Communist China, in North Korea. It should never happen in America. But, Mr. Speaker, under one-party rule, it is. But to all Americans, when we take back the House, it will stop. b1415 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. More than 800 Americans have come to testify before our committee, the minority leader should be notified be-fore he leaves the Chamber. Four of them have categorically refused and blown off the subpoenas of the U.S. House of Representatives. The minority leader attacks our committee as partisan and political, as some of his colleagues do. Well, we are a bipartisan committee with a Demo-cratic chair and Republican vice chair. But today, the minority leader gave the game away as he boiled over with rage toward our committee. He gave the game away. He is very upset that the former chair of the House Repub-lican Conference has been telling the truth about Donald Trump’s big lie, his incitement of violent insurrection, and the attack on American constitutional democracy. And that is why he is in the very embarrassing position of having sup-ported, offered, and pressed for an inde-pendent, 9/11-style commission about the January 6 attack. And as the mi-nority leader, he asked for five Repub-licans and five Democrats. He asked for equal subpoena power on both sides, equal staff on both sides. And Chairman THOMPSON , who now chairs the January 6th Select Com-mittee and chairs the Homeland Secu-rity Committee, he agreed to it. A lot of Democrats were upset about that. They said, we are in the majority. Why should we agree to have everything 50/ 50, right down the middle? But he agreed, and the Democrats agreed, be-cause that is what the Republicans of-fered. Great. We were going to have a 9/11- style independent commission. And then you know what happened? You know who vetoed it? The fourth branch of government, Donald Trump, who some of their Members slavishly report to like sycophants. And Donald Trump said he didn’t want any investigation into the attack on this body, the Congress of the United States. He didn’t want any in-vestigation at all. And you know what the minority leader did? He walked it back. They pulled the plug on the independent commission, and that is why we ended up with the January 6th Select Com-mittee in the House of Representatives, which the Speaker has made sure is bi-partisan and has operated, in my expe-rience, Mr. Speaker, as the most bipar-tisan committee I have ever been on. Why? Because we don’t spend an hour at the beginning of each meeting with a bunch of empty partisan gimmicks and stunts; the kind we just saw, wast-ing the taxpayers’ money and time; 20 minutes of that nonsense going no-where; at the same time that there is an actual hearing taking place in Can-non 310, right now, by the Committee on Homeland Security, on the question of the border. But instead of attending the hearing, I counted at least five or six different Members who were in that conga line. I will be interested to know whether they are even going to go to the hear-ing afterwards. Instead, they come and participate in that empty, absurd rit-ual, wasting the time of this body. But the minority leader comes here and, amazingly, attacks our com-mittee, when he sabotaged his own idea. But this committee is closing in on the truth, and that is why we get all these circus antics and all the at-tempts to distract the American peo-ple. Mr. Speaker, if I had been dealt the hand that my friend from Pennsylvania has been dealt today, as a lawyer, as a Member of Congress, I suppose I would have done everything in my power to distract the House of Representatives also from the business at hand. We have two people who are flagrantly, brazenly defying the authority of the House of Representatives of the United States in order to avoid coming here to tell the truth. They are acting in contempt of Congress, and we must hold them in contempt of Congress be-cause of that. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. To my colleague from Maryland, I will argue this case any day of the week, and I think that, ultimately, this will be resolved by the courts. I have got stacks, like I said, of case law to support my argument. But to call what you just saw absurd, or a waste of time, I don’t think the American people think it is absurd to care about the crisis at our southern border; the amount of illegal immi-grants coming across the border; the amount of fentanyl that is coming across the border that is literally kill-ing people in the interior. Let’s look at some numbers on this. Just last week, the CBP confirmed  more than 300,000 illegal immigrants evaded Border Patrol, just in the last 6 months alone. Alarmingly, Border Patrol warned that the Biden border crisis is already worsening in anticipation of the ad-ministration’s rollback of title 42. You just heard 68 Republicans, plus the Republican leader, request to con-sider legislation that will provide for stringent enforcement of title 42, which allows illegal immigrants to be quickly expelled from the United States. But clearly, House Democrats aren’t concerned about the biggest migration crisis our Nation has ever faced. So let’s try this another way. If we defeat the previous question, I will personally offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act of 2021. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amend-ment into the RECORD , along with any extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote for the previous ques-tion. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, here to explain the amendment is the bill’s author. I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL ), my good friend. Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that we can immediately consider my bill, H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, which pre-vents the introduction of new COVID cases, as well as other infectious dis-eases, from our land and sea borders with Canada and Mexico. This was the very first bill I introduced when I came to Congress, and re-cent events have proved it to be the most important ever. Just this week, The New York Times warned readers to prepare for a new wave of COVID. We also can prepare for a new wave of migrants, about 18,000 a day, when they take title 42 away. The Biden administration has consistently advocated mandates, mask-ing, lockdowns, and other extreme measures on our American citizens. Yet, they ignore the single biggest dan-ger for the new wave of COVID to rav-age America: unvetted, untested illegal aliens who are allowed to flood our southern border, unhindered. The Biden border crisis has exploded after 1 year under this President. His administration demonizes the men and women of Border Patrol and ICE, re-fuses to enforce immigration law or en-hance border security, and allows hun-dreds of thousands of illegal immi-grants to disappear into the mainland without vetting. There were 165,000 encounters at our southern border in February, and we are on track to hit 2 million in fiscal year 2022. Despite this clear and present danger to the people of the United States and the integrity of our borders, the Biden administration still seeks to throw away the few tools available to fix the situation, like remain in Mexico and title 42. Title 42 has been an effective containment and mitigation strategy, re-sulting in the reduced introduction of COVID–19 into the U.S. from outside our borders, by making it easier to turn away illegal aliens traveling from or through countries with continuing COVID cases. My PAUSE Act would keep title 42 in place until: All State and Federal man-dates, requirements, and limitations related to COVID end; all public health emergencies for COVID are over; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduces the traveler health risk level for Canada and Mexico to level 1, which they are currently level 3. Eliminating title 42 at this point is reckless and harmful to our national security and our communities. It will lead to more illegal immigration, more drugs, and more hardship on everyday Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the PAUSE Act, preserve title 42, and stand up to protect both the health and borders of the American people. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I wanted to go back to something else that the minority leader said in echo of the minority floor leader’s points. They cling to the suggestion that there is no valid legislative purpose being conducted by the January 6th Se-lect Committee; and they also say it is unlawfully composed. Well, that has been rejected by several courts. In fact, all of the argu-ments that they are making have been rejected by the courts. I don’t think they have won a single case in court yet. But check out Budowich v. Pelosi with Judge Boasberg, or Eastman v. Thompson, where these courts said, not only is there a valid legislative pur-pose, but this is the quintessential leg-islative purpose; that is, guaranteeing the preservation of democratic self- government. If it is not a valid legisla-tive purpose to investigate violent at-tacks, insurrections, and attempted coups against the government of the United States, then what is a valid pur-pose? The courts have said, the courts have got that right. They have written opinions. I guess we are going to have to send a copy to the minority leader because he is apparently oblivious to it. But even without the courts slapping down everything they are saying over there, just think about it. Would they really want to say that if there are vio-lent attacks taking place against the Capitol we can’t investigate it? The Eastman decision also rejected the claim that we are somehow unlaw-fully composed. I have got to say something on behalf of Representative LIZCHENEY , who I probably disagree with on 90 percent of the issues we vote on here. But she was just maligned and castigated by the minority leader in an utterly unfair way. She has operated with nothing but patriotism for this country and con-stitutional patriotism for the rule of law and the processes that define us. And they can overthrow her as the head of their caucus because she doesn’t bow down on the altar of Don-ald Trump and Vladimir Putin the way that the gentlewoman from Georgia was heckling me does. And they can at-tack her because she thinks for herself and doesn’t act like a cult member. But we won’t do that, even though we disagree with her on a lot of issues, but she is a constitutional patriot, and I feel she is owed an apology. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Ben Shapiro says the ‘‘facts don’t care about your feelings,’’ and they don’t. And I will say this: The case law doesn’t care about what your political position is. So if you want to talk about more case law, how about Trump v. Thomp-son, 2022, Justice Kavanaugh ruled: ‘‘A former President must be able to suc-cessfully invoke the Presidential com-munications privilege for communica-tions that occurred during his Presi-dency, even if the current President does not support the privilege claim.’’ I have got more and more case law that I could produce. But let’s just go back to the fact that this select com-mittee is a partisan political hit job. If this really had a legitimate legislative function, then let me ask you this: Where are the subpoenas for the former House Sergeant at Arms and the former head of the D.C. National Guard? We haven’t seen those sub-poenas. What about questions and subpoenas that are designed to elicit information about why this Capitol was left unpre-pared and how to prevent it from hap-pening again? That would be a legiti-mate legislative function. What we are seeing is this committee masquerading as if it is some kind of grand jury, which is wholly inappro-priate and a violation of the separation of powers. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. ROY), to talk more about this. Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question. The gentleman from Maryland, my friend, raised some issues about saying that we are wast-ing time when we have stunts, he called them, I think, or I am para-phrasing. So here I am, and I am going to be talking about an important issue which, I assume, might be labeled as a  stunt, to say that I oppose the previous question because there is something for me that is so critical and so existential to the people I represent in the State of Texas and to the people across this country, which is the decision by the CDC, in conjunction with the Depart-ment of Homeland Security Secretary, and the President of the United States, to end title 42 enforcement on the bor-der of the United States. Now, our mutual colleague and friend who was in the chair, and the Speaker from Texas, Ms. JACKSON LEE, who is on the Judiciary Committee, raised the issue about the imminent harm that may befall us because of the continued and new strains of COVID in April. Well, if that is true, why would the CDC say that we should stop enforce-ment of title 42 at our border? We have 8,000 people a day coming across the border of the United States and being apprehended; 8,000. Half of those are being turned away under title 42. The estimates by Border Patrol ex-perts are that those numbers will swell to over 10,000, maybe as high as 15 to 18,000, when you get to the summer months. And when that happens, and you stop enforcing title 42, then all of those in-dividuals will be released into the United States. b1430 That is a major problem because it is not just the numbers themselves; it is the consequences. When Border Patrol is processing individuals because of the failed policies of the administration, it means that you have, as we saw last year, half a million people who were known got-aways because Border Pa-trol is now at the locations to process individuals. Then you have known got-aways, which means you have massive num-bers of people coming here with crimi-nal records from places all over the world, 150 to 160 countries, including dangerous individuals from known ter-rorist states. The point here is that we have legislation for this body, the people’s House, to require title 42 to be en-forced. YVETTE HERRELL , my colleague from New Mexico, introduced that last February. I filed a discharge petition for that bill last April because, for the people watching at home, the Speaker of the House controls the floor, and my Democratic colleagues control the floor. The only way we have power to change that is through a discharge pe-tition. We have 211 signatures. We have all Republicans, I think save maybe one, who have signed the discharge pe-tition. We are asking our Democratic colleagues to join us in defense of the United States to call up this discharge petition so we can have a debate on title 42 and securing the border of the United States, which is what that conga line was all about: trying to pro-tect our country. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman goes, I want to tell the gentleman from Texas that I would never accuse him of performing a stunt. I was referring to the people who should have been in the Homeland Security Committee hearing actually dealing with the issue they profess to be talking about here on the floor under completely different aus-pices. Let me go back to the questions offered by my distinguished friend from Pennsylvania who said, well, if they really did have a valid legislative pur-pose, as all these courts are saying, then they would be talking to the former Sergeant at Arms—well, we have—and we would be talking to the National Guard—we have. Somebody is going to have to dust off the talking points over on that side be-cause we have heard from more than 800 people who were involved. This has nothing to do with any kind of ideological witch hunt; this has to do with an assault on American demo-cratic institutions. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 31⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. C AMMACK ). Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I am here today to rise in support of order-ing the previous question on Congress-woman HERRELL ’s bill, the SHIELD Act, that would stop the Biden admin-istration from ending title 42, the very necessary public health order used by CBP officials at the southwest border. Since President Biden took office in January of last year, Customs and Bor-der Protection have encountered over 2 million illegal immigrants at the southern border. This number is more than at any other time during the Trump administration and still con-tinues to astonish those of us who have actually visited the border to see what is happening there. Unlike the trafficker in chief, who would rather retreat to his beach house in Delaware than face the American people, or the so-called border czar, who visited El Paso once and figured that that was good enough, I myself have been to the border three times to see this crisis for myself. In fact, over 70 percent of my Republican colleagues have been to see the tragic crisis un-folding there. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I have followed this issue from the very beginning and have feared the very day when title 42 would be rescinded for political purposes. Speaking of political purposes, I find it exceptionally hypocritical that this very Chamber is still utilizing proxy voting under the guise of a public health concern. In fact, on March 29, the Speaker extended proxy voting through May 14 of this year because of ‘‘the ongoing public health crisis.’’ It is curious that the Speaker doesn’t seem to think that our own border being overrun by 2 million undocu-mented people has no bearing on the safety of the general American public, but a Congress of 435 Members with an 80 percent vaccination rate seems to qualify for an ‘‘ongoing public health crisis.’’ That, to me, screams hypoc-risy. Furthermore, there are Members of this Chamber who have been voting ‘‘present’’ via proxy. The hypocrisy and the irony are not lost on me nor the American people, Mr. Speaker. Additionally, every single one of my colleagues who decided to show up here today had to wear a mask to get on a plane. That mandate is still in place due to the ongoing public health crisis. Mr. Speaker, we have two very clear instances here in this Chamber where the ‘‘ongoing public health crisis’’ is used as a justification for policy deci-sions. Why not the safety, then, for all Americans and our communities across this country by securing the border? Why not uphold and keep title 42 in place? If you have ever spoken to a CBP officer or a Border Patrol agent, they will tell you that title 42 is necessary, that ending it will send even more peo-ple to the southern border. It is a mag-net. Ending it will prolong the crisis. It will grow the crisis. It will once and for all put an end to national security as we know it. Take it from the wife of a first responder who deals with this crisis every single day. I have had dozens of Border Patrol agents text and call me the last few days, begging for help to hold the line on title 42. They have said: Please, Congress, hold the line on title 42. It must be protected because it is the only policy in place currently that, in the slightest, will slow this surge that we have watched grow be-fore our eyes. If you stand with our Border Patrol agents, if you stand with the American people, if you give a damn about our communities, then you will support the SHIELD Act. \n",

      "Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. KATKO ), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the previous question and in support of H.R. 471, the Protecting Americans from Unneces-sary Spread upon Entry from COVID–19 Act, the PAUSE Act. This week, I joined Leader MCCARTHY  and several of my colleagues at a meet-ing with the National Border Patrol Council, representatives of 18,000 mem-bers of the Border Patrol, to discuss the crisis at the southern border. Just as we predicted, the number of daily border encounters has been trending dramatically upward since  President Biden took office in 2021. The administration has created an unten-able situation from which it may take several years, at a minimum, to re-cover. The irresponsible decision to roll back Title 42, the Public Health and Welfare authority; the halting of bor-der wall construction; the lack of sup-port for frontline law enforcement per-sonnel; the undermining of the Migrant Protection Protocols; and the total ab-sence of a long-term border security plan of any sort have only made mat-ters worse. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is now seeing over 7,000 encounters daily, and the Department of Homeland Security is said to be bracing for a sig-nificant mass influx of nearly 18,000 mi-grants daily when title 42 ends. That is absolutely an untenable situation. As the U.S. finally gets a handle on managing the spread of new variants and moves steadily toward a post-pan-demic recovery, now is not the time to end the use of title 42 and jeopardize all that progress, especially as numerous countries continue to struggle with the rapid spread of COVID–19 and strength-ening variants. The very purpose of title 42 is to prevent the introduction of dangerous communicable diseases into American communities. We should be doubling down on protecting our communities and economy from these threats, not weakening them. Our border security and immigration system cannot handle any more pull factors, as the Biden administration has proven unwilling to secure our southern border. As we are witnessing, the administration continues to strip every tool for managing the border cri-sis away from frontline law enforce-ment. \n",

      "Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels are taking full advan-tage by highlighting the weak border security posture of the administration while profiting from this crisis. The ad-ministration continues to roll back commonsense border security meas-ures, thereby feeding into a false nar-rative for would-be migrants and en-couraging them to come to the United States to seek asylum. Many migrants who make this dangerous journey to the United States will not be eligible under the Federal law for asylum, forcing them to seek other ways to enter the United States. We know for a fact that cartels control who crosses the U.S.-Mexico bor-der. They charge migrants exorbitant fees knowing that some will never be able to repay, leading many of the mi-grants with only one option: to work off their fees. \n",

      "Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from New York. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, this work often leads them into a trafficking sit-uation here in the United States. Drugs, such as fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other fentanyl-laced drugs, are pouring across the southern border and destroying our communities and ending the lives of thousands of Americans every year. This year alone, for the first time, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses. That is directly related to the border. It has to stop. I appreciate the focus of my colleagues on this critical homeland secu-rity issue, especially my colleague from New Mexico, who knows firsthand the impact the border crisis is having on our communities. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman leaves, I want to say a word about the distinguished gentleman from New York. We are all blessed to have Mr. KATKO as a colleague. He is a brilliant lawyer and a man of exceptional char-acter and honor. He was the one who had been tasked by the minority leader to negotiate with the majority about creating an independent commission to investigate the assault on American democracy that took place on January 6. He was given very specific instructions, and he came back a winner. He had gotten an agreement for five Republicans and five Democrats, equal subpoena power right down the middle. Alas for his caucus, alas for this Congress, alas for the country, the leader-ship pulled the rug out from beneath him. We are going to be very sorry to see Mr. KATKO leave Congress at the end of this session. We will all be impover-ished by his absence. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, behold the nonpartisan na-ture of the January 6th Committee. It puzzles me why it would have been so different had the allegedly bipartisan commission been approved. In fact, in the January 6th Committee’s markup on the contempt resolu-tions, the grand inquisitor said, in opening: ‘‘I can say confidently that the many involved in the run-up to January 6, an oath, a statement of fi-delity to our democracy, was nothing more to them than meaningless words. I fear what happens if those people are again given the reins of power.’’ This sums up the purpose of the January 6 inquisition in a way that is both co-gent and terrifying. What the January 6th Committee lacks in bona fide legislative purpose, not patina of legislative purpose but bona fide legislative purpose, it makes up for in pure political vendetta. This investigation isn’t about truth or de-mocracy; it is a pure political power play. The immediate target is President Trump, but the ultimate target is those people—namely, the millions of Americans—who voted for President Trump. Why is there no dissent from this objective on this committee? Well, be-cause the only Members nominally rep-resentative of the minority, chosen by the majority Speaker over the objec-tion of the minority, share the polit-ical objectives of the grand inquisitor. Accordingly, LIZCHENEY said during the January 6th Committee markup of these contempt resolutions: ‘‘Our com-mittee will continue to litigate to ob-tain the testimony we need.’’ What need? To inform what legislative pur-pose does the committee need to obtain the RNC’s contributor data and infor-mation, to discover who opened its emails and clicked through to donation pages? On the other hand, it could serve her purpose to demonize her political oppo-nents, especially those who donate to President Trump. \n",

      "Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, it is common for the zealot to lose the capacity for irony. Hence, Chairman THOMPSON says that laws prohibit doing politics on the clock: ‘‘It is important that taxpayer dollars don’t support political activity.’’ Ms. CHENEY waves the Constitution even while she poses as the designee of the minority, imposed on the minority in a historically unprecedented tram-pling of the institutional norms. This is a kangaroo court, a court of the star chamber. They continue to trample the concepts and the institutional norms of the Congress, and I am certain that the American people will have an answer for it very soon. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the people of the United States deserve to know the truth. With all the ranting of my friends across the aisle, the Con-stitution indicates that this Nation was formed to create a more perfect Union. b1445 There were those who incited January 6. There were those who surrounded President Trump who did nothing to stop the violence and terrorism of Jan-uary 6. If witnesses come before a duly authorized bipartisan committee and refuse to provide the American people with the truth, then we need to stand here and provide them with a contempt order so that the truth can be found.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this contempt order for the truth for the American people and the sanctity of the Con-stitution. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to check if there are any further speakers that my friend from across the aisle has. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speaker, at this time I have no further speakers, and I yield myself the bal-ance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I consider the gentleman across the aisle a friend, and it is certainly an honor and a privi-lege to debate law with him given the fact that he is a renowned constitu-tional law expert. I mean that sin-cerely. It is fun being up here with the gentleman. So knowing that he has the last word, I do just have to cite one more case for my good friend. I just keep going back to the Trump v. Thompson where Justice Kavanaugh said that there are only two very nar-row exceptions to this privilege. Num-ber one, which can be found in United States v. Nixon, relates to a pending criminal trial. There is no pending criminal trial here. That exception is not applicable. The second narrow exception is one found in Senate Select Committee v. Nixon. In there, it is whether the sub-poenaed evidence is demonstrably crit-ical to the responsible fulfillment of a committee’s function. I am quoting the precedent here. That case law goes on to state that there are clear differences between Congress’ legislative tasks and the responsibility of a grand jury. He went on further to describe that Congress frequently legislates on the basis of conflicting information pro-vided in its hearings all the time. So I would submit that that exception does not apply either. Reasonable minds can differ, but I am very confident that the case law here supports the case of Mr. Scavino. With that said, the law notwithstanding, it seems that my friends across the aisle have proven time and time again that they don’t care about the separation of powers, they don’t care about the protection of our con-stitutional rights, and they don’t even care about the rules of the House. They only do if those items fit a political narrative. It is very clear to me that from the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol’s treatment of Mr. Scavino and from the resolution before us today that they would prefer to keep up their political theater rather than conduct a legitimate congres-sional investigation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank my friend from Pennsylvania. Sometimes when I hear him in the committee, I think about another great Republican who served in the House of Representatives from Penn-sylvania, Thaddeus Stevens. But today, my friend let me down a little bit be-cause Thaddeus Stevens was a great enemy of insurrection and rebellion. He led the forces in this Congress who in-sisted upon accountability for the peo-ple who would dare wage war against the Congress of the United States and against the Union and the people who were all elected to serve and to rep-resent. Justice Kavanaugh, of course, was not ruling in the case that my good friend cited before. He was just opin-ing. There was no ruling there. So that was one Justice’s opinion. My friend cuts me to the quick when he says that we don’t care about the separation of powers. I think I am going to have to turn that insult around and say that they don’t care about the separation of powers because the executive privilege of the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, going all the way back to 1953, in a case called the United States v. Reynolds that the ex-ecutive privilege may be invoked only by the President of the United States. And this President of the United States, who represents the Article II branch, has said he is not invoking it on behalf of Scavino or Navarro. He has rejected it. The funny part is that the former President they talked about hasn’t even shown up to try to invoke it. And what they are talking about doing could never be the subject of executive privilege anyway because it is political activity, which is a crime under the Hatch Act. It is criminal activity. It is a crime to engage in insurrection and coup. How could executive privilege—even if you had a President who wanted nothing more than to try to drape the activities of Scavino and Navarro in executive privilege, how could that President ever prove that it applied? Navarro’s job, for example, was the trade adviser. This has nothing to do with trade. He was engaged in trying to overthrow a Presidential election, as Judge Carter said last week. Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of the utmost solemnity and seriousness to the American people. We are talking about the survival of American demo-cratic government. For most of human history, people have lived under people like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, the kings, the queens, the dic-tators, the tyrants, and the bullies whom some people would want to flat-ter. But we have something else going on here in America. We have got a project in democratic self-government. Lincoln knew how tenuous it was. He asked whether government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall last or shall perish from the Earth. That is the question facing us, too. So let’s deal with all the issues and controversies we want. But couldn’t we get together and all stand up for the institutions of the country? We are doing that in our committee, which is bipartisan. I fear that some-times we are moving into a Demo-cratic/Republican caucus in Congress and a Trump caucus. There are those of us, like Ms. CHENEY , like Mr. KINZINGER , and like Mr. T HOMPSON on the committee, who want to work to-gether to get to the bottom of this and then to deal with the problems of the country. And then there are those, like the minority leader, who will follow the will of Donald Trump if he says he doesn’t want any investigation at all. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but that is where we are today. These two wit-nesses have acted with contempt to-wards Congress and the American peo-ple. We must hold them in contempt of Congress and the American people. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of yet another Con-tempt of Congress resolution that has no pur-pose other than to punish. If the January 6th Select Committee wanted to actually compel production of the documents and records they subpoenaed, they would instead be suing for civil enforcement. But that takes time, and there are only eight months left before these subpoenas expire. Congressional Committees may conduct investigations in pursuit of a legislative purpose. I ask: What legislative purpose would be served by referring Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino for criminal Contempt of Congress rather than suing for civil enforcement? Additionally, the question of executive privilege is not legally settled. President Biden has stated he would not grant executive privilege regarding Mr. Scavino’s testimony, but the Presidential Records Act governs presidential records, not the testimony of aides to former presidents. The committee also demanded ri-diculous compliance timelines in requests to Mr. Scavino, further indicating a lack of willing-ness to undertake a legitimate and thorough investigation. As we get closer to the end of the year, will the Select Committee go straight to recom-mending Contempt of Congress for every sub-poenaed individual that requests accommoda-tions or an extended timeline? I urge a no vote on this misguided resolution. The material previously referred to by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1023 At the end of the resolution, add the following: SEC. 2.

      "Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, this morning the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 1033, providing for consideration of H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 2022 under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small Business, self- executes a manager’s amendment from Chairwoman VELA´ZQUEZ , and provides one motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to adopt the rule and sup-port critical funding for restaurants and other small businesses across our Nation. As we all know, small businesses—especially restaurants—are the backbone of our local economy. Not only for the revenue they bring in, but for the many local workers they employ; fami-lies that need their paycheck now more than ever. But sadly, restaurants have been some of the hardest-hit businesses throughout the COVID–19 crisis, and many have struggled to keep their doors open. Many of us have made a promise to support workers, families, and busi-nesses in their time of need, and that is why we established the Restaurant Re-vitalization Fund in the American Res-cue Plan, which provided $28.6 billion in emergency assistance to eligible res-taurants, bars, and qualifying busi-nesses impacted by the COVID crisis. This program was clearly a success, providing relief to more than 100,000 restaurants and food and beverage businesses across the Nation. Some re-cent estimates show the program saved over 900,000 jobs, and 96 percent of re-cipients said the grant made it more likely they would stay in business. However, there is no question that our initial investment was not enough. The program ran out of funds in just 3 weeks, as the total funding requested exceeded $72 billion, far more than the $28.6 billion provided for in the Amer-ican Rescue Plan.  This funding gap resulted in 178,000 restaurants who are unable to secure funding in this program, even though they applied to the program and met all of the eligibility requirements. Let me say that again, 178,000 restaurants, many of which are in danger of perma-nent closure if Congress does not pro-vide them with the relief they need. The underlying legislation, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Businesses Act, would provide for $42 billion to replenish the Restaurant Re-vitalization Fund, giving the Small Business Administration the funding necessary to close this funding gap and process the applications of those enti-ties who are deemed eligible in the ini-tial application period, providing a life-line for the restaurant industry that has faced so many challenges over the past 2 years. In addition to this critical funding, the underlying legislation also pro-vides $13 billion for a new Hard Hit In-dustries Award Program, which will grant much-needed relief to other small businesses across industries and sectors that were the hardest hit by the pandemic but were not eligible for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund or Shuttered Venue Operators Grant pro-gram. This new program would prioritize those eligible small businesses that ex-perience the heaviest pandemic-related losses, beginning with those that lost 80 percent of their revenue. To pay for both the establishment of the new program and the replenish-ment of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, this bill would use funds re-claimed, seized, or returned to the Fed-eral Government from bad actors at-tempting to defraud previous recovery programs. Back in October 2020, the Small Business Administration Office of the In-spector General had already identified $78 billion in potentially fraudulent loans and grants to ineligible entities, and more than 300 individuals have been brought to justice. This legisla-tion also increases oversight and audit requirements, ensuring that this addi-tional support goes to the businesses originally intended to receive assist-ance. Mr. Speaker, I have always been an advocate of additional support for the restaurant and hospitality industry, and many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have dem-onstrated support for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, as well. I hope we continue to see bipartisan support for this effort on the House floor. I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation to deliver critical funding for res-taurants and small businesses in com-munities across the country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding me the customary 30 min-utes, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Today, we are here to consider a rule providing for consideration of H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act. This legislation gives a check to the Small Business Administration with-out accountability or oversight mecha-nisms or even taking into account SBA’s feedback. Mr. Speaker, this bill appropriates an additional $55 billion to restaurants and small businesses, none of which is paid for. According to the Congres-sional Budget Office, as much as $340 billion in unobligated funds from var-ious COVID relief legislation is avail-able for expenditure, but we are not re-allocating those. Instead, we would be relying on more deficit spending to provide these sums. Structurally, this bill is not going to work. This is a lot of money, and it seems that Democrats just want to throw it to the wind, be-cause when you look at how the funds are being distributed, this bill will not fix the problem. This is something that could have been addressed had the bill gone through the committee process. Because this bill is not immediately or responsibly paid for, it would fur-ther fuel the inflation crisis, which currently sits at a 40-year high of 7.9 percent. Inflation is the number one problem facing small businesses, ac-cording to them. That is what they are saying. Instead of pushing through drastic increases of inflation-inducing deficit spending, we must work to-gether to advance progrowth policies that empower small businesses to oper-ate independently without burdensome restrictions. I need to point out the political game Democrats are playing this session. They are proposing bills that have ti-tles that make them seem like com-monsense bills, but really, they are dis-ingenuous attempts to fix real prob-lems. This was true of last week’s insulin bill, and it is true of this bill. What is worse is they know that they are not coming up with real solutions. That is why we are now looking at yet another bill that has not been through the com-mittee process, there has been no transparency, no opportunity to dis-cuss, no public or minority input, and has real flaws as a result that will only exacerbate the problems my colleagues have created. My Democratic col-leagues do not want to negotiate with Republicans or allow any input from anyone to come up with a bill that would actually help people. It is also why my colleagues did not take up the ENTREE Act, which was introduced last summer, at a time when restaurants really needed it. That bill was also aimed at helping res-taurants and small businesses recover from the damage done by the pandemic with proper oversight and constraints and didn’t include discriminatory lan-guage that prioritized certain groups based on criteria other than need. That eventually, the Supreme Court had to put a stop to. Now, we need to be focusing on the crises that are going on that are going to become problems for restaurants this year: workforce and inflation. We are still seeing ‘‘help wanted’’ signs all over the country. Businesses are des-perate for a workforce. Congress needs to stop paying people to stay at home and encourage them to work. And in-flation is hitting every single corner of the economy. Between increasing prices on all goods, and the effects we are already starting to feel in the food industry from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, consumers are going to start feeling the pain. And, unfortunately, when you are trying to save money, going out to eat is not one of the first things a family typically does. We need to be getting ahead of these issues, not coming up with insincere attempts under the guise of COVID relief. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill, and I ask Members to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I always appreciate hearing from my colleagues and a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, Mrs. FISCHBACH . I do note, however, a couple of things before I yield some time. The first is that as it relates to how the bill is funded, as I indicated, the in-spector general himself, that office, in-dicated there is $78 billion in fraudu-lent claims that are being recouped by the Federal Government. This bill will cost $42 billion for the Restaurant Re-vitalization Fund replenishment, an-other $13 billion, $55 billion. There is plenty of money in those reclaimed dollars to be able to pay for this with-out having to appropriate new dollars. So this actually should be in line with the principles of some of our more con-servative Members to have claimed dollars that are owed to the United States and to its taxpayers. Secondly, as it relates to workforce shortages, and I think we all know in every industry, and the businesses I talk to back home, are struggling to find workers. Yet, I note yesterday in the Education and Labor Committee, of which I am a member, that we didn’t get a single Republican vote for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, WIOA’s reauthorization, which will do great things to continue to move people into the workplace as quickly as possible. Yet, we received no support for that. So we are going to continue to work on these issues here in this Congress. We are going to continue to lead. This majority is going to continue to look out for small businesses, it is going to continue to look out for people looking for work, and it is going to continue to look out for employers who face work-er shortages. So we will continue to support this, and I believe this bill will be a great victory for the 178,000 res-taurants who desperately need our sup-port.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. DESAULNIER ), a fellow member of the Rules Committee. b1600 Mr. D ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding. And I also want to thank my distinguished colleagues on both sides for the conversation at the Rules Committee. I want to speak for a few moments, Mr. Speaker, as somebody who has spent 35 years in the restaurant busi-ness, owning and managing restaurants in California, small businesses that were vital to the communities where they were; and how important they are to restart Main Street America in every district; the multipliers of hav-ing restaurants open, and the difficulty and the cash flow of a small business like this, and why this initiative is so important. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that in 2019, there were 12.1 mil-lion people employed in the restaurant and food service industry. So many of those people immediately lost their jobs and their incomes with no warning when the pandemic hit. In April of 2020 alone, the restaurant industry lost 51⁄2 million jobs. Through the American Rescue Plan, we established the Restaurant Revital-ization Fund, which provided $28.6 bil-lion in emergency assistance to eligible restaurants, bars, and qualifying busi-nesses impacted by the pandemic. Although this program helped more than 100,000 restaurants and food and beverage businesses across the country, in every district, the program received applications of nearly three times the amount of money that it had to give out. We cannot overlook the obvious need. The Relief for Restaurants and Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, H.R. 3807, would inject $42 billion to allow the Small Business Administration to process the applications of over 150,000 eligible entities that previously applied for relief. I met and talked to many of my former colleagues in the business who have applied for these funds and they speak very positively about their expe-rience and how helpful it was to get them through the pandemic. It helps these small businesses. Through the pandemic, at least 40 percent of pan-demic-related revenue loss was suffered by businesses with fewer than 200 em-ployees. Again, as a former restaurant owner myself, I have seen how restaurants can bring communities together. We owe it to these local business entre-preneurs, these owners, and millions of workers who depend on this help, to pass this important bill. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I would just like to mention, we continue to talk about whether or not this is paid for. I respectfully ask: Where is the CBO score? That would answer the question if we actually had done any— put this legislation through any kind of process, through committee, getting the CBO score. So I would question as to whether or not it was actually all paid for, as my colleague mentions. But I do think that if we had the CBO score, we could decide, finally, if it was paid for or not. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I completely agree that we should be trying to help small businesses who have gotten absolutely railroaded and run over by the power of government, which amounts to, essentially, a tak-ing. They have had their livelihoods taken away through the sheer power of government, Federal, State and local. It is absolutely extraordinary. It is one of the reasons that I worked with my friend, DEANPHILLIPS , on the other side of the aisle, on the PPP Flexibility Act 2 years ago. I would have preferred we not go down this road; that the government not go down and shut down our economy. But the government did. And I think that amounts to something akin to a tak-ing. But now, here we sit and, yet again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not met an issue that they can’t make worse; and that is what we are faced with right now. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues are bringing forward a $55 billion bill which they say is paid for, which is paid for and relies on recaptured, fraudulent relief funds. We have fraud-ulent relief funds because you just dumped $2 trillion out in the economy when you came in here and did it by voice vote 2 years ago. So you have got these fraudulent funds that we may or may not recap-ture that is, allegedly, what is paying for this. This bill should be fully paid for out of existing COVID money that has not yet been spent. And that is what we are offering as an alternative. But the real problem that the American people need to understand that my colleagues have got themselves in a pretty vicious box, is because the ad-ministration, with the full support of my colleagues here, made the alloca-tion of dollars race-based. They made it criteria-based. And they got slapped down by the court. They got slapped down by the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals found race and sex prioritization was unconstitutional and ordered the Small Business Administration to halt the practice. But most of the funding had been spent. It was underfunded. But most of that funding had been spent. The court said: ‘‘The case is about whether the government can allocate limited coronavirus relief funds based on the race and sex of the applicants. We hold that it cannot. ‘‘The stark realities of the Small Business Administration’s racial gerry-mandering are inescapable.’’ ‘‘It is indeed ‘a sordid business’. . . . ‘‘quoting our Chief Justice John Roberts, ‘‘ . . . ‘a sordid business’ to divide ‘us up by race.’ ’’ ‘‘And the government’s at-tempt to do so here violates the Con-stitution.’’ That is the real story. I have introduced the Restaurant Revitalization Fund Fairness Act. We have got other bills on this side of the aisle that would pay for it; that would ensure that it won’t be race-based; that would make sure that the 177,000 applicants who were left on the outside looking in be-cause of race-based governing by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that that would not occur; and that, again—I want to reiterate— should be paid for without relying on the possibility of collecting the fraudu-lent expenditures. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to just reiterate, this is really a simple issue. And there may be at-tempts to distract from what is a sim-ple issue, but the Office of Inspector General indicated that we had $78 bil-lion in fraudulent claims. That is an estimate. Some estimates range as high as $200 billion. It seems silly to me that we wouldn’t take advantage of those dollars which are being reclaimed to continue to try to get relief for the many, many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of restaurants and their employees across the country. And I dare say that when I talk to— I have sat down with many, many res-taurant owners in the last several months who had made application, and, simply, didn’t have the resources in the fund that we had allocated to get re-lief, continue to talk to me about this. So this is really a very, very simple question. I know there are a lot of com-plicated, nuanced questions around here in Congress that we are always dealing with. This is a simple one: Do we want to help these small businesses, or do we choose not to help them? And I think we would argue here that they very much deserve and merit this sup-port. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), another distinguished member of the Rules Committee. Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the urgent need for addi-tional relief for our restaurants. Since the COVID–19 pandemic began, restaurants in my district and across the country have been at the front line of our battle against COVID–19. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund offered a vital lifeline at a time when restaurants desperately needed our help. However, the funds quickly ran out, leaving hundreds of thousands of restaurants without any relief, includ-ing in my State of North Carolina. In a cruel twist, many restaurants were approved for funding, but never saw a dime.  For example, Kim Hammer, who owns Bittersweet in Raleigh, was ap-proved for a grant by the Small Busi-ness Association. Despite this, Kim still hasn’t received any relief and said, ‘‘It feels like no one is listening.’’ Well, we are listening. Every time a new variant emerges and cases surge, the survival of countless restaurants is thrown into jeopardy. As I hear from restaurant owners in my district, they all tell me how essential the restaurant relief program was; but that it simply was not enough. During the peak surge of the Omicron variant, Cheetie Kumar, the owner of Garland restaurant in Ra-leigh, said she just hoped she could keep the doors open for both her cus-tomers and for her staff. Jennifer Cramer, the owner of Catalan Taps restaurant in Cary, had to start a GoFundMe campaign to keep her lights on and her employees on payroll. Mr. Speaker, our fight against this pandemic is not over. It is unaccept-able that we would leave the res-taurant industry out to dry. Res-taurants contribute to the spirit, vi-brancy, and success of my community in Wake County, North Carolina, and many communities all across this Na-tion. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation and replenish this fund. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of Congress-woman MCMORRIS RODGERS and Congressman W ESTERMAN ’s American Energy Independence from Russia Act. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amend-ment in the RECORD , along with the extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. \n",

      "Mr. CARSON ). Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Min-nesota? There was no objection. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, for the fifth time, Republicans ask their colleagues to consider this bill. The av-erage price at the pump two days be-fore President Biden took office was $2.38 per gallon. They have been stead-ily climbing ever since. On February 14, 6 days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the aver-age price for per gallon was $3.49. These prices are affecting every single Amer-ican. When adjusted for the increasing prices on all goods, thanks to failed Democrat policies, wages and salaries are below pre-pandemic levels. My con-stituents are pleading with Congress to focus on this issue and are being ig-nored by the out-of-touch majority. Now, for the fifth time, House Republicans are urging the majority to im-mediately bring relief at the pump now. While my colleagues continue to bring flawed, misguided, and unvetted legislation to the floor, House Repub-licans stand ready to work on issues that directly affect American’s pocket-books. To further explain the amendment, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK ). Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from the great State of Minnesota for yield-ing. I rise today to defeat the previous question so that we may immediately consider H.R. 6858, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers’ bill, that would strengthen United States energy secu-rity, encourage and promote domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, and help return to and solidify Amer-ican energy independence. You know, I get asked all the time, why? Why will Congress do nothing to lower the cost of fuel? Why do they continue to talk and do absolutely nothing? Well, right here—right here is your answer. Today, Republicans stand, for the fifth time, legislation Today, Re-publicans stand, for the fifth time, leg-islation in hand, to bring gas prices down and to restart our energy produc-tion right here at home; legislation that would make us energy inde-pendent, once again, and that would get thousands of Americans back to work; legislation that would be a col-lective sigh of relief for our seniors, and those on fixed incomes, who are making the decision between gas or groceries. This legislation is the an-swer, and it is ready to go. But you know what? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have al-ready been given vote recommenda-tions by the Speaker of the House to shoot this legislation down. They haven’t even read it. They haven’t even read it, and they are so blind to and be-holden to their radical agenda that they won’t consider a commonsense so-lution to one of the most pressing issues facing all of our collective con-stituents, these fuel prices. Again, this is the fifth time that this legislation has been presented, and it is the fifth time that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have put Russia first and America last. The average price of gas today is $4.56 and climbing. For our truckers and farmers who fuel up on diesel, like many in my district, it is costing them well over $5 a gallon at the pump. In fact, it is $5.19 today for a gallon of die-sel. All across our country, Americans, regardless of party, are making deci-sions, again, between gas in the tank or groceries in the fridge. Folks are canceling their first road trip with their family in 2 years, or visits to grandparents, because Biden has de-cided that Americans who put fuel in their own gas tanks and shop for their own groceries, they are not the pri-ority. b1615 In fact, just 17 hours ago, the Biden administration was more concerned with presenting former President Barack Obama with a ceremonial pen than talking about how we are going to bring down fuel prices in this country. You want to talk about out of touch. There it is in a nutshell. This is the Biden energy policy: soaring prices that hurt hardworking Americans and increasing reliance on foreign countries to meet our energy needs. We know that America’s future will not be realized by sunshine and pin-wheels. We will realize it by boosting domestic production and ending our de-pendence on countries that don’t have our best interests in mind. Heck, they don’t even like us. I have spoken to foresters and farmers in my district who have told me that energy costs alone are driving them out of operation and out of busi-ness. To illustrate this, one of the top timber producers in my own district said he is spending $18,000 more a week on fuel costs alone. If this continues, he will be suspending operations, all because this administration has issued our domestic energy industry a death sentence. That happened even before they took office. This Biden energy plan, or lack thereof, is ruining the financial hopes and dreams of hardworking Americans and destroying farmers, foresters, fam-ilies, ranchers, and small businesses. We know that we can put an end to this energy crisis. We know we can, but instead, we are focused on ceremonial pens and issues that do not matter to the American people. It is long past time that we end this energy crisis and put American energy security and independence at the top of the priority list. I stand before this body and the American people to say that we, too, have had enough. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can immediately bring Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers’ legislation to the floor. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, frankly, I am a little perplexed. I think when I get home and talk to my restaurant owners, they are going to say: Why were you having a conversation about something not re-lated to the restaurant revitalization act? I will explain to them that as much as I would like to get into a conversa-tion about how Putin’s aggressive ac-tions in Ukraine have affected gas prices around the world, as much as I would like to have the conversation about oil companies that have decided to continue to reap record profits and not increase supply to meet the de-mand around the world, as much as we can talk about all those things, that is not why we are here today. We should have that conversation in an appro-priate venue.  This conversation and the venue right now that we are in is to talk about the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. It is to talk about the 178,000 res-taurants owned by Republicans, Demo-crats, and Independents all across America in every single district that we have the privilege of representing. Every single district has restaurants, and that is what we are here to talk about: how to get relief into the hands of those individuals who, for 2 years, have struggled under the most difficult economic circumstances any of us could ever imagine. Let’s make sure we keep our eye on the ball. Let’s continue to focus on the question in front of the House. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON ), my friend and distinguished member of the Rules Committee. Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, in southeastern Pennsylvania, and in cit-ies and towns across the country, res-taurants are an essential cornerstone of our local communities and our re-gional economies. These restaurants were hard-hit by the pandemic. Despite the excellence of their cuisine, over the past 2 years, many inde-pendent restaurants in Philly, Dela-ware County, and Montgomery County struggled to stay in business, and some permanently shuttered. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, passed as part of the American Rescue Plan, was a lifeline for the restaurants that received it. The program provided grants targeted to the hardest-hit res-taurants, giving restaurant operators financial relief to keep their doors open and keep people employed. The funds weren’t enough to match the need. I have heard it from my con-stituents, and everybody who is listen-ing has heard it from their constitu-ents. While roughly 300,000 restaurants applied for aid, only about 100,000 re-ceived grants. For months, I have joined Representative BLUMENAUER and my colleagues in calling to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, using only funds recouped from fraudulent claims that have been made in earlier small busi-ness relief programs. The Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act will provide additional financial support to restaurants and small businesses in the industries that are still grievously affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Speaker, I am glad this needed bill is getting a vote on the floor. I strongly support the rule and its un-derlying legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to recognize that this issue is still before us and to do the same. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that my colleague from New York would love to have the conversation, would love to have the conversation in the appro-priate venue, and I think we would also love to have that conversation, particularly in a committee if we could hear the bill. But the majority has cho-sen to shut out almost every single Re-publican bill and not hold hearings where that would be the appropriate venue. For now, I suggest to my colleague from New York that he talk to his leadership about actually hearing this bill in committee, having the conversa-tion, and having the transparency and the input that we could from the pub-lic. Until that time, Mr. Speaker, this is our venue. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL). Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question so we can amend the rules to immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American En-ergy Independence from Russia Act. My friends from the other side of the aisle want to talk about restaurants, and restaurants are very important, but understand that when families can’t put fuel in their tank, they cer-tainly cannot afford to eat in a res-taurant. We have to get our priorities straight. Yes, we are bringing them up now because we cannot get our bills to the floor. We cannot get our message out. This is the fourth time the Republicans have tried to bring this bill up for a vote, and each time, the Demo-crats have refused. Families are suffering as rising fuel costs are making everything much, much more expensive, including bread, clothes, and everything, including meals at our restaurants. President Biden’s so-called solutions do nothing to fix the problems. Tap-ping into our strategic reserves will do almost nothing to bring prices down. All it does is risk our reserves and en-danger our national security. This administration is signaling to the oil and gas companies that they are going to come after them. Big Government needs to get out of the way. Get out of the way of the busi-nesses, and let the businesses run themselves. For example, where I am from on the Gulf Coast, the Department of the Inte-rior has allowed one lease sale in the past year and a half. Under Trump, we had two a year. We had the one sale that I am talking about in a year and a half. The Biden administration refuses to uphold the law of two per year, even though the courts struck down the one that he had. He refuses to challenge that to get those lease bids acknowl-edged. Biden, what he has said is a lie. I am sorry, it is an outright lie about what the drilling companies are. There are so many rules and regulations on the drilling companies. I understand it. We have to get the foot of the government off the back of the necks of our drilling companies. Let’s save this country. Let’s don’t give it away to Russia. Let’s don’t give it away to Venezuela. Let’s stand firm and be Americans, both sides of the aisle here. I am sorry, I will cool off here on this one. Republicans have a real solution to get American energy back on the mar-ket and get prices down. This bill will restart the Keystone XL; it will end the moratorium; and it will boost the LNG exports. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do want to just correct the record as it relates to the En-ergy and Commerce Committee. I think, just this morning, the com-mittee held a hearing with the heads of oil companies, multinational oil com-panies, to bring them in to talk about why they refuse to increase supply, which would bring down the costs. I didn’t do exceptionally well in economics when I was in the State Univer-sity of New York, but I do remember the old supply and demand issue. When demand is high and supply is low, prices rise. We are going to continue to work and push and urge those compa-nies to increase supply to meet demand and bring the costs down. There is not much we can do about what is going on in Ukraine, although we are desperately trying to help our brothers and sisters there defend their democracy, which has had an incred-ible impact on gas prices. Let me also remind everyone who is tuning in, who is watching what is going on, that the issue before the House of Representatives today, the rule that is being considered, is dealing with the difficulties that have been faced by restaurants across this coun-try during the pandemic, which has now lasted for nearly 2 years: the dis-placement of workers and the impact that it has had on communities all across this country. We are striving to achieve a solution here that will be good for everyone across all 50 States and these small businesses that con-tinue to be the backbone of our local economies. Mr. Speaker, I have been very grateful for the leadership of Mr. BLUMENAUER , who has led the charge on this issue for some time now. I think I have probably bothered him dozens of times to ask what we can continue to do to advance his efforts, and he has continued to provide leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER ), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy and I appreciate his leadership and te-nacity in terms of trying to help our beleaguered neighborhood restaurants. Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle—even if they got their dream piece of legislation—would not  make any difference on the price of gasoline this year or next year. We are dealing with global supply. One of the things that will make a difference to break the grip that we have with the oligarchs and the sheikhs is being able to deal with renewable energy that is not going to hold us hostage. We have seen remarkable progress that is made. I am sad that our friends on the other side of the aisle have been resistant to these innovations in terms of solar, wind, electrification, the things that will really make a dif-ference today and tomorrow and help fight the crisis that we face with cli-mate change and global warming. This legislation will make a difference to 177,000 small neighborhood restaurants and other distressed busi-nesses. From the beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, these neighbor-hood facilities have been the hardest hit. You have heard already that they were subject to over 4 million jobs lost in the first few months of the pandemic. The unemployment in the restaurant industry remains stubbornly high, and approximately 90,000 restaurants have permanently closed since the start of the pandemic. We have heard from countless others that are teetering on the edge. Restaurants are the cornerstone of a livable community. They have em-ployed nearly 60 percent of Americans at some point in their career. I would venture to say that many of us on the floor of the House have had that expe-rience. They are a major source of em-ployment for people of color and women, and they support a $1 trillion supply chain from farm to table. The Federal Government has provided help for those institutions through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, a program based on my RES-TAURANTS Act that I introduced in June of 2020, but the program was over-subscribed and underfunded. Only one- third of all applicants were funded, leaving 177,000 hanging in the balance. The relief for restaurants and other hard-hit small businesses will finish that job. More than 235 Members of the House are cosponsors of this legisla-tion, the RESTAURANTS Act, includ-ing two dozen of my Republican col-leagues. My legislation will provide $42 billion to help fund those restaurants that had not previously received awards fin-ishing everybody who is in line. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Oregon. b1630 Mr. BLUMENAUER. The legislation provides $13 billion for a separate in-dustry neutral fund for small busi-nesses that have been disproportion-ately hard hit by the pandemic, such as live events, travel, hospitality, and fit-ness. We have all heard from them in our Districts. Finally, the legislation extends the period of time that Shuttered Venue Operators Grants can be spent to har-monize it with the Restaurant Revital-ization Fund. Best of all, this bill can be paid for with fraudulent pandemic relief funds that are recovered. Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to finish the job protecting our neighbor-hood restaurants and other distressed businesses. I am proud to have spon-sored this. I deeply appreciate the broad bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, and I hope we will enact it today. I support the rule. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, restaurants and small businesses are facing difficulties, and one of those challenges is high energy costs. Delivery costs go up. It costs more for their employees to get to work. It costs more for all of those things because of high energy costs. So this does affect restaurants and small businesses. I think this affects res-taurants, small businesses, and every American. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. OBERNOLTE ). Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so that we can immediately consider the American Energy Independence from Russia Act. Mr. Speaker, last night I held a townhall with over 2,000 of my constituents. Do you know what was top of mind to those people? It was not the previous question. It was energy prices in America, and par-ticularly, the price of fuel. Mr. Speaker, it was heartbreaking to hear from constituent after con-stituent after constituent who said that they were unable to afford the en-ergy required to get to work and back just to put food on the table for their families. Mr. Speaker, you can imagine how embarrassing and heartbreaking it was for me to have to admit to my con-stituents that the reason for those high energy prices was the actions of their very own government. Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of the current administration, there has been a concerted effort to constrain the supply of energy produced here in America. What we have is a classic problem of supply and demand. We don’t have enough supply, and yet this administration in its very first week issued an executive order completely halting the issuance of new gas and oil exploration permits on Federal lands in this country. It issued an executive order stopping the Keystone XL pipe-line. Mr. Speaker, that pipeline alone, if it were in operation today, would allow us to import more than enough oil to completely offset our oil imports from Russia. The tragic thing about this situation is that the administration is doing this out of the mistaken belief that it will make the planet greener. But nothing could be further from the truth. We produce energy more cleanly here in America than any other country on Earth. So when we take actions that require us to import more oil from places like Venezuela, which has a 50 percent high-er lifecycle greenhouse gas emission per barrel of oil than oil produced here in America, and when we increase oil imports from places like Russia that still utilize dirty practices like meth-ane flaring—things we haven’t done here in years—we are actually increas-ing global greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Speaker, if we increase energy production here, not only will we lower prices for our constituents who are suf-fering, and not only will we increase our national security, but we will also make our planet a cleaner place. Mr. Speaker, I urge immediate consideration of the American Independ-ence from Russia Act. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from the State of Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership. I thank, of course, the chairwoman of the Small Business Committee, Mr. BLUMENAUER , and the many supporters who have pro-vided support for this legislation. I am hoping that as my colleagues begin to see the light, that they will understand that it will be far worse for all of the employees who are in res-taurants that may close that they will not even be employed to think about paying for any gas prices no matter how much they might be. I stand with them to ensure that inflation goes down and that we respond to gasoline prices. But they are not clear in what we are doing today. We are helping small and hard-hit busi-nesses—sole proprietors, independent contractors, and businesses that are not over 200 employees—to keep these employees who have suffered from the devastation of the pandemic. We are doing more. We are not spending an extra penny because we are cap-turing those dollars from those who fraudulently used dollars before. So we are making good on our promise to spend the American tax dollars cor-rectly. We are having a data collection. We are going to have oversight on this particular program to ensure that it is spent effectively. We are going to respond, if you will, to the needs of the mom and pops, the really oldest and distinguished res-taurants like This is It in Houston, Texas; Burns Original BBQ; and J&J; as people who have stood the storm yet, have kept employees but that didn’t know whether they could keep their doors open. This is an important and vital piece of legislation. I support the underlying legislation, which is the bill that deals with relief for restaurants and other hard-hit small businesses and the un-derlying rule. Don’t you get it?  We are keeping businesses open and keeping people employed. That is what we are doing today. Support the rule and the underlying bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule to consider H.R. 3807, the ‘‘Relief for Restaurants and Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 2022,’’ which provides $70.6 billion in FY2022 for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this committee is reconsidering this critical piece of legislation for America’s restaurant owners. The American Rescue Plan made great progress in providing the funding in an equi-table manner, prioritizing women, veteran, and economically and socially disadvantaged res-taurant owners. In addition, the majority of funds were reserved for restaurants whose gross receipts were no more than $1,500,000 dollars. It is essential to promote equity through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund Mr. Speaker, considering that only 8 percent of restaurants are owned by blacks and 23.8% of Asian owned businesses are restaurants. As legisla-tors we must do everything we can to ensure their survival. To underscore the personal importance this funding holds to me, I would like to mention a widely loved, black owned, and historic Third Ward restaurant: Cream Burger. Cream Burger sits on the corner of Elgin and Scott and has been in operation for 60 years. It is a cash only restaurant that has only had two additions to the menu across the entirety of its existence: chili cheese fries and bacon. The Greenwood family has been serving the residents of the Third Ward their delicious burgers and homemade ice cream for dec-ades and has no plans of closing any time soon. The original owners of the restaurant, Verna and Willie Greenwood, opened the restaurant to generate their own income and create generational wealth, which they certainly have done. Ever since their tragic passing, the busi-ness is now owned and operated by their daughters, Beverly and Sandra. Beverly and Sandra hope to pass the business onto the next generation of children so they can, ‘‘see it through. Maybe 100 years,’’ Beverly said. The restaurant sees a range of Third Ward customers every day, from the students at the University of Houston to the cashiers working at the historic Houston Food Mart just down the street. Cream Burger is iconic in the city of Houston, and I hold it in the highest reverence. It, and so many restaurants like it, is one of those restaurants that would receive funds from this legislation. It is for that reason Mr. Speaker I support the rule to consider H.R. 3807, the ‘‘Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Busi-nesses Act of 2022.’’ It will help save so many businesses like the beloved Cream Burger, so I urge my colleagues to support the rule as well. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER -MEEKS ). Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me time to speak on this critical issue. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to defeat the previous question so we can take up H.R. 6858, the American Energy Independence from Russia Act. This commonsense legislation in-troduced by Representatives MCMORRIS  RODGERS and W ESTERMAN would require President Biden to submit an en-ergy security plan to Congress to evaluate U.S. oil and natural gas im-ports, identify importing countries that pose an energy security risk to America, and encourage domestic pro-duction of oil and natural gas to offset imports from Russia. In fact, in contrast to our colleague’s statement, Iowa is a leader in renew-able energy. Fifty percent of our en-ergy comes from renewable sources. We even pay restaurants for their unused and old cooking oil. We are an energy exporter, and it is all done without a government mandate. All of the oil im-ported from Russia could be offset by ethanol made from corn in Iowa. In order for the U.S. to become energy independent and secure, we must have an all-of-the-above energy policy. We must unleash our natural resources and produce our own clean, efficient energy here at home to ensure low en-ergy prices and promote American jobs in our communities. Rather than promoting policies that hamper U.S. energy production and ceding security to adversarial nations like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, we should promote exploration here at home and unleash our potential. We must ensure that the current ban on Russian energy is sustainable by prioritizing U.S. energy production, in-cluding biofuels. Just last week, the President released a budget proposal that included $45 billion on new taxes on domestic energy production. This comes on top of other disastrous decisions over the past year and a half such as those that halt the Keystone XL pipeline and the current delay over the 5-year program for offshore energy leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. These policies are not work-ing for hardworking American families and businesses who are dealing with high inflation and skyrocketing gas prices. The American Independence from Russia Act would immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline, remove re-strictions on U.S. LNG exports, restart oil and gas leasing on Federal lands and waters, and protect energy and mineral development. These are key steps we can take to promote U.S. en-ergy security, and we must take action now. For this reason, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Support H.R. 6858 to make America energy independent and se-cure by voting ‘‘no’’ on the previous question. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I will say this, that I suspect when, hope-fully, this bill becomes law and we have helped save the 178,000 res-taurants around this country that a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be taking credit for it. I hope many of them vote for it despite their unwillingness to really have a conversation about it today and to talk about extraneous issues. Before I reserve the balance of my time, I include in the RECORD a January 24, 2022, article from CNBC entitled ‘‘National Restaurant Association asks Congress for more grant money as omi-cron hits industry.’’ [From CNBC, Jan. 24, 2022] NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION ASKS CONGRESS FOR MOREGRANT MONEY AS OMICRON HITSINDUSTRY  (By Amelia Lucas) The National Restaurant Association is asking Congress to replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund as the Covid omicron variant hits operators’ businesses. Last year, lawmakers created the $28.6 billion fund to aid bars and restaurants strug-gling in the wake of the pandemic. The grants were designed to make up for a res-taurant’s full pandemic losses of up to $5 million for a single location or $10 million for a business with fewer than 20 locations. Publicly traded companies were ineligible, but their franchisees could still apply. Since the fund was depleted, restaurants have been pushing for Congress to replenish it. Several lawmakers have introduced legis-lation to do so, but the bills haven’t gained traction, and the Biden administration hasn’t appeared interested in supporting the measures. But the latest surge in Covid–19 cases and its impact on restaurants could change minds. The National Restaurant Association’s latest survey of operators found that 88% of res-taurants saw indoor dining demand wane be-cause of the omicron variant. More than three-quarters of respondents told the trade group that business conditions are worse now than three months ago. And the majority of operators said their restaurant is less profit-able now than it was before the pandemic. ‘‘Alarmingly, the industry still hasn’t recreated the more than 650,000 jobs lost early in the pandemic, a loss 45 percent more than the next closest industry,’’ the trade group’s top lobbyist, Sean Kennedy, wrote in a letter to congressional leadership for both parties. Kennedy also touted the benefits of the first round of RRF grants. The trade group estimates that more than 900,000 restaurants jobs were saved by the initial round of fund-ing, and 96 percent of recipients said the grant made it more likely they could stay in business. A full replenishment of the fund would save more than 1.6 million jobs, ac-cording to the trade group’s estimates. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate that my colleague from New York talks about an extraneous issue. But gas prices and the cost of energy in America is a serious issue, and it is fac-ing every American. Every American is paying more at the pump, and they are facing the decision in their family budget of how they are going to use that. In 2020, the last administration added 30 million barrels of oil to the Stra-tegic Petroleum Reserve. Now the Biden administration is weighing a plan to release roughly 1 million bar-rels of oil a day from this reserve for months on end, and this is after he re-leased 30 million barrels in early March  and 50 million barrels of oil back in November which did nothing to prevent a spike in energy prices. Congresswoman MCMORRIS RODGERS  and Congressman W ESTERMAN have introduced the American Energy Inde-pendence Act to reverse President Biden’s disastrous anti-American en-ergy policies. This bill is a real solu-tion, and it needs to be heard. We need to talk about this to the American peo-ple. This bill, H.R. 3807, that we have before us is not going to help restaurants and small businesses. But, of course, that is not the Democrats’ intention anyway. If it were, they would have brought this bill through committee and worked with Republicans to build an effective piece of legislation. Instead, their intention is to push this legislation through that sounds good so that they can use it as a talk-ing point to distract from their failed policies. This bill is just another exam-ple of the Democrats’ reckless spending habits. Their solution to the effects of inflation is to throw even more money at it. When will my colleagues learn that spending is what causes the inflation? It is time for more pro-growth policies, not government handouts. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and the underlying bill, I ask Members to do the same, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank my colleague and friend, Mrs. FISCHBACH . We spend a lot of time together in the Rules Committee, and I always appre-ciate our conversations. While we may not agree on issues from time to time, I always appreciate her earnestness, and I appreciate her good work. I want to thank all of my colleagues for their words in support of the rule before us today. As I mentioned earlier, Congress acted last year to provide much-needed relief for restaurants and other small businesses, but we must do much more. Our economy simply cannot survive without small businesses, and it is paramount that we redouble our com-mitment to ensuring their continued success. I pledge to always be an ally in that fight, and I know my colleagues join me in that. I look forward to voting in favor of this effort to bring much-need-ed relief to local restaurants and the small business community.

      "Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to start our debate by talking a little bit about what the American people ought to expect of their leaders, of those who hold posi-tions of public trust and the respon-sibilities that come with it. I have been thinking about those responsibilities for more than 50 years, in all the time I have been fortunate enough to hold a position of public trust. It doesn’t matter if you are an alderman, a mayor, Member of Con-gress, President of the United States, or a staff member working as a civil servant, or a political appointee. When you work for the public, when the peo-ple’s taxes pay your salary, those jobs come with serious rules and serious ob-ligations. Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro both held positions of public trust. Mr. Scavino was a top communications of-ficial in the Trump White House. Mr. Navarro was a trade adviser. They each drew salaries paid by the American people to the tune of over $180,000 per year. They both were to abide by cer-tain rules and obligations. They both swore oaths of allegiance to the Con-stitution. The select committee wants to talk to both of them, but about a lot more than their White House jobs. We want to talk to them about their roles in trying to overturn the 2020 election. We subpoenaed them for their records and testimony. They told us to buzz off. Not a single record. No-shows for their deposition. Their excuse was: As former White House employees, the information we wanted—again, information about overturning an election—was shielded by executive privilege, a protection for the President to make sure sensitive, official conversations stay private. In other words, they are arguing that their roles in trying to overturn an election had to stay secret because they had official roles as advisers to the ex-President. If they want to make those claims, ridiculous as they sound, here is what the law requires: They need to show up and make those claims on the record, under oath. They refused to do that. That alone means they are in contempt of Congress. But I want to dig a little deeper into the argument these men are making. As I mentioned before, these are rules and obligations that bind public servants. One of the most important rule is that you can’t do campaign work on government time or using tax-payer money. Pretty straightforward. Plenty you can do on your own time, but not when you are on the clock. That is the law. If you have heard of the Hatch Act, it has probably been when a Cabinet Sec-retary or White House official had crossed the line from their official du-ties into political matters. In fact, in 2020, Mr. Navarro was dinged by a government watchdog for violating the Hatch Act by using his official role to attack President Joe Biden. That law prohibits, among other things, some-one from using ‘‘official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the results of an elec-tion.’’ Sounds familiar? In the case of Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino, trying to af-fect the result of an election wasn’t knocking on doors or putting signs in people’s front yards. They were trying to help a defeated President stay in power. It is not conceivable that their involvement in that effort could have legally overlapped with their official duties. But beyond that, it was a betrayal of the oath these men took. It was a be-trayal of the public trust. Even if you do it on your own time, trying to over-turn an election is still trying to over-turn an election. We know that the people who stormed this building on January 6 had the same goal: trying to overturn an election. That is what the select committee is investigating. That is why we need to hear from Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro. But as the select committee works to provide answers to the American peo-ple, these two are saying: ‘‘I worked at the White House when all this took place. Even if I was plotting to over-turn the government, I was collecting a government salary at the time, so I don’t have to talk about it.’’ Can you imagine? I have served my community and my country most of my life. Like my colleagues in this body, I have labored to uphold my oath and do right by the people I serve. I know my constituents expect that of me. To run into this kind of obstruction, this kind of cynical behavior, as we in-vestigate a violent insurrection, is just despicable. It can’t stand. Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro must be held accountable for their abuses of the public trust. They must be held ac-countable for their defiance of the law. They are in contempt of Congress, which is a crime, and I call on my col-leagues to do their duty to defend this institution and the rule of law and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the select committee has now conducted over 800 interviews and depositions of witnesses who have knowledge of the events of January 6. This includes more than a dozen former Trump White House staff members. Mr. Speaker, when you hear my colleagues make political, partisan at-tacks on the select committee, I hope that all of us can remember some basic facts: Through these interviews, we have learned that President Trump and his team were warned in advance, and repeatedly, that the efforts they under-took to overturn the 2020 election  would violate the law and our Constitution; they were warned that Janu-ary 6 could, and likely would, turn vio-lent; and they were told repeatedly by our State and Federal courts, by our Justice Department, and by agencies of our intelligence community, that the allegations of widespread fraud, suffi-cient to overturn an election, were false and were unsupported by the evi-dence. Yet, despite all of these specific warnings, President Trump and his team moved willfully through multiple means to attempt to halt the peaceful transfer of power, to halt the constitu-tional process for counting votes, and to shatter the constitutional bedrock of our great Nation. As a Federal judge has recently concluded, the illegality of President Trump’s plan for January 6 was ‘‘obvi-ous.’’ We are here today to address two specific witnesses who have refused to ap-pear for testimony before the com-mittee. The committee has many questions for Mr. Scavino about his political so-cial media work for President Trump, including his interactions with an on-line forum called ‘‘theDonald.win’’ and with QAnon, a bizarre and dangerous cult. Mr. Scavino worked directly with President Trump to spread President Trump’s false message that the elec-tion was stolen and to recruit Ameri-cans to come to Washington on Janu-ary 6 to ‘‘take back their country.’’ This effort to deceive was widely effec-tive and widely destructive, and Don-ald Trump’s stolen election campaign succeeded in provoking the violence on January 6. On this point, there is no doubt. The committee has videos, interviews, and sworn statements from violent rioters demonstrating these facts. Mr. Navarro will also be a key witness. He has written a book boasting about his role in planning and coordi-nating the activity of January 6. We have many questions for Mr. Navarro, including about his communications with Roger Stone and Steve Bannon re-garding the planning for January 6. As Judge Carter recently concluded: ‘‘Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the joint session of Congress on Janu-ary 6, 2021.’’ In the case of both of these witnesses, Mr. Speaker, the committee would rather have their testimony than have to move this contempt citation. When you hear my colleagues attack the se-lect committee, remember Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro have chosen not to appear. They did not have to make this choice, but they did. In America, no one is above the law. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro is some form of roy-alty. There is no such thing in America as the privileges of the crown. Every citizen has a duty to comply with a subpoena. Mr. Speaker, when you hear my colleagues challenge the committee’s leg-islative purpose, remember the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States have affirmed our legis-lative purpose. Too many Republicans are, once again, ignoring the rulings of the courts, as many of them did in the run-up to January 6. Mr. Speaker, the tale of what happened following the 2020 election, re-sulting in the violence of January 6, is a tale of stunning deceit. It is a tale of lies about our election and contempt for the rulings of our courts. The election claims made by Donald Trump were so frivolous and so un-founded that the President’s lead law-yer did not just lose these cases; he lost his license to practice law. The New York Supreme Court found: ‘‘There is uncontroverted evidence that Mr. Giuliani communicated demon-strably false and misleading state-ments to courts, lawmakers, and the public at large in his capacity as law-yer for former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump’s failed effort at reelection in 2020.’’ b1700 Mr. Speaker, those in this Chamber who continue to embrace the former President and his dangerous and de-structive lies ought to take a good, hard look at themselves. At a moment of real danger to our Republic, when the need for fidelity to our Constitu-tion is paramount, they have aban-doned their oaths in order to perform for Donald Trump. That will be their legacy. Mr. Speaker, this is not a close call. Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino have cho-sen not to comply with a congressional subpoena. They are in contempt. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I hope this is the last time that we do this. Just last week, we watched members of the January 6th Select Committee criticize the DOJ for not jailing their political opponents fast enough. Now the committee is trying to refer two more of President Trump’s advis-ers to the DOJ for criminal prosecu-tion. The same DOJ, by the way, that has slandered concerned parents as do-mestic terrorists; a DOJ overseen by a President who said President Trump should be prosecuted. So let’s be clear, we aren’t voting today to rename a post office. So, please, let’s be honest with ourselves. A vote to hold Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress is a vote to put them in jail for a year. Nei-ther of these men deserve this. The party line isn’t a good enough excuse today. Disliking their politics isn’t an excuse. Mr. Scavino has two boys. He is a good dad. He doesn’t deserve this. His boys definitely don’t deserve this. So before we vote today, I have got to ask, could anyone here explain to those boys why their dad deserves to be be-hind bars for a year? Mr. Scavino grew up in a working- class family in New York City. He is a former caddy who worked his way up to the White House through hard work and determination. Mr. Scavino lived the American Dream. Now, thanks to the select committee, he is living an authoritarian nightmare. The select committee will say that it is Mr. Scavino’s fault for refusing to cooperate. That is simply not true. Mr. Scavino asked time and again for the committee to follow the rule of law and provide him with a narrow and specific legislative purpose for the information that they were seeking. He asked, ‘‘How is what you want from me perti-nent to your investigation?’’ And they refused to explain. But remember what they said last week. The January 6th Committee must enforce its subpoenas. But con-tempt is not enforcement; it is punish-ment. Contempt won’t get the com-mittee any information. Only the court can do that. But they don’t want to go to the judiciary. They don’t want neu-tral arbitration. They want political punishment. The select committee has never been interested in factfinding. In fact, JIM JORDAN and I were both blocked from sitting on the committee because we promised to fully investigate the secu-rity failure at the Capitol. The Demo-crat leaders don’t want that. They claim they blocked us for being too partisan. Meanwhile, the committee’s lead staffer signed his name to a false letter calling the Hunter Biden laptop Rus-sian disinformation. Apparently, lying to undermine democracy is a key qual-ification for employment of this com-mittee. If the January 6th Committee gets its way, Congress will have referred four former Trump officials for pros-ecution in under 6 months, another record for the 117th Congress. The select committee aims to do two things: silence legitimate questions about the breakdown of security at the Capitol and punish their political oppo-nents. It is that simple. Dan Scavino is accused of listening to his boss, the former Commander in Chief, who told him to ‘‘invoke all ap-plicable privileges and immunities.’’ Today’s vote is not about wrongdoing, and it isn’t about anybody’s character, no matter what they say. Today’s vote is about the character of this House. It is about abusing the seat of our democracy to attack Amer-ican democracy. The question is, do we live in a country where you can go to jail for working for the wrong politi-cian? Would you want to live in that country? The question is, will you help create that country? Because I think we have had a pretty good thing going for the last 240 years, and that is ex-actly why I urge all of my colleagues  to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution today. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, just for the record, let me say that we are here for this con-tempt process today, but the Presi-dent’s own daughter complied with the wishes of the committee. I would think that if his daughter complied with the wishes of the committee, everyone else should, even the people who worked for him. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER ), the distinguished majority leader of the House. Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for yielding. I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for her courage in standing for the truth. I disagree with many things that the previous speaker said. I disagree with his premises and with his conclusion in many respects. But I do agree with him on one thing: This vote is about the character of the House—I agree with him on that—which is why 435 of us ought to vote for this resolution, so that the House can do its duty. Madam Speaker, once again we are forced to take this step, asking the Justice Department to charge individ-uals with criminal contempt for refus-ing to answer subpoenas as issued by the committee investigating the at-tack on our Capitol and our democracy on January 6, 2021. The two gentlemen of which the previous speaker spoke I don’t know. I have no quarrel with them individ-ually. But we are a Nation of laws, not of men, and if we are to be a Nation of laws, then we need to respond to legal process; and if we think the assertions are wrong, we need to make our case. On the merits of this resolution there should be no doubt, and it is about the character of this House, the courage of this House to seek honesty, to seek truth. The individuals in question had intimate knowledge of the former President’s actions and decisions on that day. No matter who their children are, no matter what their life has been, they have knowledge that it is impor-tant for the American people to have through their Representatives in Con-gress. Americans must have a full accounting of what transpired on January 6 and in the weeks leading up to it and perhaps subsequent. That is what the bipartisan select committee has been tasked with undertaking, by a vote of this House. Sadly, I expect maybe most of my colleagues across the aisle will vote against this resolution. It is about the character of this House. Perhaps they agree with the Republican National Committee, which has said that the violent Trump-led insur-rection at the U.S. Capitol, the deaths and injury of U.S. Capitol police offi-cers, and an effort to prevent the cer-tification of an election was, and I quote the Republican National Com-mittee, ‘‘legitimate political discourse.’’ How can anybody make that assertion? How can anybody in the Repub-lican National Committee vote for it? Why doesn’t everybody on the Repub-lican Party side of the aisle say, ‘‘That is not what we believe’’? Silence pre-vails. There is no doubt that the insurrection on January 6 itself was a danger to our democracy, but I agree with The Washington Post columnist and former White House speech writer for Repub-lican President George W. Bush, Mi-chael Gerson, who wrote on December 16, ‘‘It is Republican tolerance for the intolerable that threatens American democracy.’’ Very frankly, my friends on the other side of the aisle ought to be cele-brating those in their ranks who have the courage to stand up for the truth. I have told LIZCHENEY , if J OHN KENNEDY were writing his book on Profiles in Courage today, I would urge him to include her and ADAM KINZINGER in that book. January 6 was a day of peril for America, but the greater crisis is when one of our two main political parties has become so hijacked by extremism and so enthralled to a dangerous dema-gogue that it condones, even celebrates insurrection and violence. Madam Speaker, how can the same party that claims it honors law en-forcement simultaneously declare that violent attacks against police officers are legitimate? How can one of our two political parties be so craven for short- term partisan gain that it is willing to encourage and condone insurrection? How can its Members use their sacred votes in the House, the people’s House, in an effort to impede the investigation of this dark and dangerous day in the history of our democracy? That is what this vote is about. Not only the character of this House, but the character of this country, the char-acter of the people who demand, hope-fully, truth, because that is what will set us all free. Because that is what this vote is about: Whether you believe that the violent attack on January 6, one in which a mob threatened the life of the Republican Vice President and threat-ened the life of the Speaker of this House—the Speaker of all the House— in an attempt to overthrow our democ-racy, does that constitute legitimate political discourse? Madam Speaker, I can’t believe Americans believe that. We must reject that theory, that the violence that we saw on January 6, the hate that we saw on January 6, is somehow legitimate political dis-course, because if people believe that, then our democracy is in grave danger. This vote is about whether you believe a certain individual can be held above the law in our country. It is about whether you believe the American peo-ple deserve to know all the facts about January 6 and whether those respon-sible for the attack ought to be held re-sponsible. And most fundamentally, Madam Speaker, it is about whether the Congress can fulfill its constitu-tional responsibility and ability to de-termine the truth. Madam Speaker, this vote will reveal to us who was willing to show toler-ance for the intolerable. It will reveal to us who is willing to stand up and de-fend our democracy and the rule of law, irrespective of party, irrespective of personality. That is a call to patriot-ism, to love of country and to love of Constitution. My fellow colleagues, let us do our duty to the Constitution, to the Dec-laration, to our democracy, and to the people we represent. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I think it is very important, as our col-leagues consider their vote on this res-olution, to keep in mind the facts. Number one, neither Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro has appeared in front of this committee. As I mentioned ear-lier, we have interviewed over 800 wit-nesses. The vast majority of them have cooperated fully and answered our questions. Some of the witnesses have taken the Fifth. Some of the witnesses have answered some questions and as-serted a privilege on other questions. But the notion that somehow the former President can instruct someone not to appear, that is not sustainable, that is not found anywhere in the law. If Mr. Scavino or Mr. Navarro wants to assert some kind of a privilege—and again, our questions for them have to do with their activities that are polit-ical activities that are not covered by executive privilege, but if they wish to assert that privilege, they can appear and do so. Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I would also note that in Trump v. Thompson, the D.C. Circuit held, and then we were upheld in the Supreme Court, that the committee’s need for this information outweighs the former President’s rights to any kind of con-fidentiality. I think it is important for those facts to be clear and to be on the RECORD . Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1715 Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-ida (Mr. GAETZ ). Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, gas prices are rising; the border has be-come a turnstile; inflation is crushing our fellow Americans; and here we are, back on the floor of the House, reliving January 6. Some of the members of the January 6th Committee come from the swamps of Washington, D.C. I come from the swamps of Florida, and I know alli-gator tears when I see them. Yet, we are lectured about performing for the former President. The reason Scavino and Navarro shouldn’t be held in contempt is that the January 6th Committee itself is so  performative, illegitimate, and unconstitutional, kicking off the Repub-licans that Leader MCCARTHY sent to serve on the committee. We were accused by the majority leader of having our party hijacked. Our party is ascendant, and time is on our side because when we take the ma-jority back, this nonsense will come to an end. It is baffling to me that Democrats are so eager to conduct oversight over the last administration that is out of power, but it is hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil when it comes to the Biden administration. They are more worried about Trump’s trade adviser than Joe Biden’s son trading influence for foreign money. They are more worried about Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff than deputizing the right folks to secure America’s border. The January 6th Committee is a sham. If you took the position of the committee, legally, no President would ever have privilege that would extend beyond the life of that Presidency. No President would have the ability to have candid conversations with staff and advisers that might not imme-diately come back to bite them the moment they left the Oval Office. The American people see this for the partisan exercise that it is. Probably some folks at the Justice Department even see that it is a partisan exercise because not all of these contempt cita-tions are well-received at the Justice Department right now. This contempt referral should similarly be ignored and rejected, and cer-tainly, it is a stain on this House. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. KINZINGER ), a distinguished veteran of the Air Force and a member of the se-lect committee. Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, for all practical purposes, Dan Scavino’s career is Don-ald Trump. Scavino was 16 when they met, and he is, to this day, a Trump stalwart. Scavino was central to the Trump administration’s social media program. He was, for 2 years, President Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Communica-tions. Using social media to monitor trends and shape political views was Dan Scavino’s core business. He did that for Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, and he kept doing it right on through the ‘‘stop the steal’’ and the fraudulent challenge to the 2020 election. He also monitored ex-tremist social media sites for the President. Dan Scavino was with the President on January 5 and 6. He spoke with Trump by phone several times on Janu-ary 6 and was with the President as many urged him to help stop the vio-lence at the Capitol. So, Dan Scavino could shed light on what then-Presi-dent Trump thought would happen on January 6, especially the potential for violence. Did the President know that the rally could turn violent; that his rhet-oric on the Ellipse could send an angry mob to storm the Capitol; that what on the evening of January 5 President Trump called a fired-up crowd might take it literally when, the next morn-ing, he told them to ‘‘fight hard’’; that he was pouring fuel on the flames? Dan Scavino was there, so if he were willing to do his duty as a citizen, he could tell us a lot about that. But in-stead, he has chosen to stiff-arm the American people. President Trump acknowledged that Scavino sometimes helped shape his tweets. On December 19, Trump retweeted a video that urged viewers to ‘‘fight for Trump.’’ The January 6 at-tack was then just 21⁄2weeks away. Why did Donald Trump retweet that particular message? Dan Scavino could give us the inside scoop. While Trump and his stop the steal gaggle were working hard to subvert the Constitution and steal the election for themselves, President Trump retweeted, after QAnon already had, a video called, ‘‘How to Steal an Elec-tion.’’ What would Dan Scavino say about why Trump retweeted a QAnon-blessed video on how to steal an election? He won’t risk telling us. What did President Trump’s extremist followers on ‘‘The Donald’’ and other hard-right sites make of Trump urging them to join a wild protest on January 6? Polls show that some took it as marching orders, in fact. Dan Scavino had to know they would. Dan Scavino knew very well what his boss wanted. He knew that sites like ‘‘The Donald’’ attracted violent ex-tremists. Scavino himself sent out a video that a user on that site under-stood as literal marching orders and literal war drums. President Trump and Dan Scavino had been in the White House for 4 years by then. They knew the January 6 crowd could turn violent. They knew exactly what they were doing. We are here today because Dan Scavino, a key witness, is unwilling to speak with us. He failed to produce a single document in response to the sub-poena, and he has clearly demonstrated his complete and utter contempt for Congress. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Ms. MCCOLLUM ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time. Dan Scavino’s blatant disregard for our subpoena is his effort to ensure that Congress and the American people never get the firsthand story that he has to tell. None of us should find that acceptable. It is contempt for the law and contempt for Congress. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolu-tion. Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. AGUILAR ). Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I thank the vice chair for yielding time. Madam Speaker, we have been entrusted by the American people to in-vestigate the attempt to overturn a free and fair election. That attempt to subvert the will of the American people resulted in a deadly attack on the peo-ple in this building. But it was bigger than just 1 day of violence and destruc-tion that resulted in the deaths of U.S. Capitol Police officers. For weeks, various schemes were hatched by individuals, ranging from State legislators to the former Presi-dent’s senior aides to Members of Con-gress, with a singular objective: Keep Donald Trump in office. These are the facts, Madam Speaker, facts that were backed up last week by a Federal judge, who, after reviewing some of the evidence our committee has in its possession, said, in part, ‘‘The illegality of the plan was obvi-ous.’’ We are here today to hold two individuals involved, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, in contempt of Congress. Peter Navarro has failed to comply with our investigation in any way de-spite the fact that he has given mul-tiple TV interviews. In fact, Mr. Navarro appeared on television in sup-port of the former President’s failed re-election efforts, so much so that he was found to have repeatedly violated the Hatch Act. But his political work did not stop when the election was over. We know Mr. Navarro led a call with State legis-lators about the efforts to convince Vice President Pence to delay election certification for 10 days. We know Mr. Navarro spoke to Steve Bannon, both during and after the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mr. Navarro has publicly stated that he is protected by executive privilege, but he has never sought counsel, as others have, and he has not filed any case seeking relief from his responsibil-ities to comply with our lawful sub-poena. This is a textbook case for contempt, Madam Speaker. While I am not surprised by some of my colleagues who refuse to pull their heads out of the sand and face the facts of what really happened and continues to happen, I remain deeply concerned about what this country looks like if the perpetra-tors aren’t held accountable. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1037. Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG ). Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, the fact is, President Trump has ex-erted executive privilege, and Mr. Scavino has raised the issue of execu-tive privilege at President Trump’s re-quest.  No matter how much my colleagues on the other side want to say dif-ferently, it is a legitimate assertion, considering the D.C. Circuit Court, in Nixon v. Administrator, held that the executive privilege can be raised by a former President, a determination re-cently reinforced by Justice Kavanaugh in Trump v. Thompson by stating that the right of a former President to assert executive privilege exists, even if the sitting President does not support that privilege. Con-cluding otherwise would, in fact, actu-ally eviscerate the privilege in total. Keep in mind that the ruling on executive privilege in Trump v. Thompson deals with a narrow set of documents from the National Archives. It has no bearing on whether Mr. Scavino testi-fies. The ruling does not apply to docu-ments at issue in this case, nor does it apply to the testimony sought by the committee or whether the committee has a legitimate purpose for conversa-tions between President Trump and his aide. The select committee has refused to acknowledge President Trump’s asser-tion of privilege as it applies to Mr. Scavino, and the committee takes an overexpansive view of what Trump v. Thompson actually says and fails to even acknowledge that the Supreme Court case of Nixon v. Administrator exists. This is not a settled question, and it is not nearly as clear-cut as some would have you believe. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOFGREN ), the chairperson of the Committee on House Administration and a member of the select committee. Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, no one is above the law. We have all heard that phrase. It is a bedrock principle, and we know it is what distinguishes democracies like ours from autocracies such as Russia. Sadly, a few of the former President’s closest aides and allies seem to think they are special, that they are above the law, including senior communica-tions official Daniel Scavino, Jr. Now, who is he? According to many reports, Mr. Scavino worked with the former President to use social media to spread lies regarding nonexistent elec-tion fraud and to recruit a violent, angry mob to D.C. Mr. Scavino also followed violent, extremist social media on behalf of Mr. Trump. We have reason to believe that doing so provided Mr. Scavino with ex-plicit advance warnings of the violence that was to occur on January 6. He may have shared these warnings of vio-lence with Mr. Trump before the 6th, and we need to ask him about that. He reportedly attended several meetings with Mr. Trump and others re-garding reversing the legitimate vic-tory of President Biden and was also with the former President during the Capitol attack when Mr. Trump failed to immediately try to stop it, despite urgent bipartisan calls for him to do so. Madam Speaker, a Federal court recently concluded that Mr. Trump like-ly committed a Federal felony and that he and his allies ‘‘launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election’’ that ‘‘spurred violent attacks on the seat of our Nation’s government, led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process.’’ The court said that his effort was ‘‘a coup in search of a legal theory.’’ The court found that if President Trump’s ‘‘plan had worked, it would have per-manently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American de-mocracy and the Constitution.’’ Democrats and Republicans have agreed that the very foundation of our constitutional republic was threatened. We must prevent that from ever hap-pening again. Senate Minority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL rightly explained that the public needs to know everything about what caused and occurred on January 6. To inform both the American people and legislative reform proposals, the select committee needs to speak with Mr. Scavino. He has to fulfill his legal and moral obligation to provide testi-mony and documents. Otherwise, he should face consequences. We must vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution to find him in contempt of Con-gress. In the United States of America, no one, including Mr. Scavino, is above the law. b1730 Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I know my colleague and friend, Mr. ARMSTRONG , knows very well that, first of all, executive privilege is a qualified privilege. Secondly, former President Trump has not asserted executive privilege. Third, I have tremendous respect, obviously, for Justice Kavanaugh, but my colleagues continue to quote Justice Kavanaugh without noting that the opinion in the D.C. circuit, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, in that opinion the judge found a number of things, including ‘‘to allow the privi-lege of a no-longer sitting President to prevail over Congress’ need to inves-tigate a violent attack on its home and its constitutional operations would gravely impair the basic function of the legislature.’’ The Court also held that under any of the tests advocated by former Presi-dent Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the Select Committee to Inves-tigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol far exceed his generalized concerns for executive branch confidentiality. And I would just repeat again, Madam Speaker, that Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro both have chosen not to appear in front of the committee to an-swer questions that are clearly outside of any potential claim of privilege they may have, and even if they believe there is a claim of privilege, they are obligated to appear and make that as-sertion. They cannot simply refuse to respond to the committee’s subpoena. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Madam Speaker, as a member of the committee charged with investigating the attack on our Capitol, our Con-stitution, and our country, I support this resolution to refer Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino to the Department of Justice for contempt of Congress. I will focus my remarks on Mr. Navarro. There is clear evidence that Mr. Navarro was involved in efforts to keep President Trump in power after he lost the election. We subpoenaed Mr. Navarro seeking testimony and documents regarding the actions he took to discredit the election and prevent the results from being certified. Mr. Navarro made a blanket claim of executive privilege. This claim lacks merit as a matter of law and common sense. No President, either sitting or former, has claimed privilege regarding Mr. Navarro’s testimony or documents. And Mr. Navarro has no authority to assert privilege himself. Beyond that fundamental flaw, since the election, Mr. Navarro has written and spoken widely about the subjects that are the focus of our subpoena. He is eager to tell his story, if he can do so on his terms in a way that serves his interests. He published a book where he details the actions he took to change the out-come of the election. He writes that he worked with Steve Bannon on a scheme called the ‘‘Green Bay Sweep.’’ Its pur-pose was to encourage Vice President Pence to delay certification of the votes and send the election back to State legislatures. Mr. Navarro writes that he called Attorney General Barr, urging the De-partment of Justice to support Presi-dent Trump’s efforts to challenge the election in court, which Barr declined to do. Mr. Navarro notes that he kept a journal detailing this episode and other actions he took. And finally, while he was refusing to comply with our subpoena, Mr. Navarro made numerous media appear-ances discussing his role in the events culminating on January 6. Mr. Navarro has significant relevant knowledge. He is happy to share it on television and in podcasts, but he won’t provide this information in response to a lawful subpoena. Mr. Navarro is in contempt of Congress and should be referred for pros-ecution. Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS.)  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, 15 months have passed since January 6 of 2021, yet I have seen little evidence over that time to indi-cate the necessary progress has been made to ensure the Capitol complex is more secure. And I have seen no evidence that the politicized select committee is serious about identifying or addressing the issues that led to our Capitol being so unprepared on that day, which should be its top priority. On February 17 of this year, the GAO released a report detailing the lack of security preparedness by Capitol Police leadership and the Capitol Police Board on and in the lead-up to January 6. The rank-and-file men and women who serve Congress as members of the Capitol Police put their lives on the line every day. Yet, the Capitol Police Board, controlled by Speaker PELOSI , failed them. They deserve better. Instead of working to ensure our Capitol Police officers have the tools and the training they need to prevent an-other event like January 6 or taking long-overdue steps to reform the Cap-itol Police Board, the House is once again voting on a contempt resolution because two individuals are not com-plying with another sham subpoena issued by House Democrats. I have a newsflash for members of the Select Committee: You do not have limitless power. You cannot demand testimony, documents, or even view the information of your political oppo-nents without their consent or without the law on your side. You have neither. Specifically, Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro are unable to testify on spe-cific topics that are related to their work in the White House, nor can they testify on communications between President Trump and the President’s closest advisers, as those communica-tions are protected under President Trump’s claim of executive privilege. As a reminder, the American taxpayer is spending millions of dollars on this select committee. According to The Washington Post, the select com-mittee is on pace to spend $9.3 million by the end of December. To put that into perspective, that amount exceeds the current budgets for the Committees on the Judiciary; Agri-culture; Budget; Ethics; the Committee on House Administration; Rules; Science, Space, and Technology; Small Business; Natural Resources; Homeland Security; Veterans’ Affairs; and the Permanent Select Committee on Intel-ligence. That is right, this select committee is using more taxpayer resources on their partisan investigation than Democrats have devoted to serving vet-erans, addressing rising prices in infla-tion, or helping our farmers during a massive supply chain crisis. This is nothing more than a sham investigation full of misuses of congres-sional authority, including Speaker PELOSI violating 230 years of precedent by refusing to allow the minority party to select its own committee members, failing to investigate pursuant to a valid legislative purpose, altering evi-dence to fit a certain narrative, lying to witnesses, falsely accusing wit-nesses, violating deponents’ right to challenge subpoenas, and perhaps above all, refusing to investigate why Speaker PELOSI and the Capitol Police Board left the Capitol so unprotected that day. I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), a veteran of the United States Navy. Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I have come to the floor many times over the last 3 years and discussed the oath of office. The oath to protect and defend our Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. Every Member of this body swore that oath, and it is the same oath that our President and military officers, in-cluding those like Mr. BANKS , swear in service to our Nation. That is service. When an American enlists or commissions in our Armed Forces, or when someone takes elected office, or even a senior position in the executive branch, they do so to serve the American peo-ple. Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro had the duty to serve the American people. Un-fortunately, they instead chose to serve the interests of one man, who sought to advance his own agenda at the peril of American democracy. They now have the duty to respond to the subpoenas of this committee, but they have apparently decided that they are above the law. The American people deserve the truth about the attack that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power, and the committee is united in our duty to investigate. This committee has conducted over 800 voluntary depositions and inter-views, with more scheduled, including witnesses who worked in the previous administration and even close family members of the former President. The committee has received nearly 90,000 documents pertaining to January 6, and we followed up over 435 tips re-ceived through the committee’s tip line. Hundreds of witnesses have voluntarily come forward and cooperated with our investigation, but Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro have refused to do their part. They have been given every opportunity to come forward, yet they have attempted to obstruct the pursuit of justice and to stonewall the commit-tee’s work and conceal the truth, de-spite both publicly acknowledging their roles in promoting election fraud conspiracies and counseling the former President on changing the outcome of the election. Mr. MEADOWS , and today Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro, my question remains: What are you covering up, and who are you covering for? Their failure to answer that question about January 6 is disregarding the law, and they should be held account-able. That is why I will vote, and I will urge my colleagues to vote to hold Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino in contempt of Congress. Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I think it is again very important as our colleagues are contemplating their vote on this resolution that they keep in mind the facts. And we are hearing a number of things that are not con-sistent with the facts. First of all, with respect to the establishment of the committee, Mr. DAVIS knows, and my colleagues know that we initially attempted to have a bipar-tisan commission, which, in fact, Lead-er MCCARTHY instructed Mr. K ATKO to negotiate with Chairman T HOMPSON . Mr. K ATKO did that, secured everything the Republicans asked for, at which point, Mr. MCCARTHY walked away from the bipartisan commission, and then went over to the Senate side and lobbied against the establishment of a bipartisan commission. The establishment of the select committee, again, is not what we would have hoped. The 35 Republicans who voted for the bipartisan commission wanted a bipartisan outside commis-sion, but we cannot let this attack go uninvestigated. Mr. DAVIS also knows that with respect to the membership of the com-mittee, Speaker PELOSI said that she would not name two Members who had been identified by Mr. MCCARTHY ; that is completely consistent with the reso-lution. And Mr. MCCARTHY then himself withdrew the other three and de-termined that he would not partici-pate. Finally, Madam Speaker, I continue to hear this allegation that the com-mittee is not investigating what hap-pened at the Capitol, not investigating what happened with respect to the Cap-itol Police, not investigating what hap-pened with respect to security that day. That is just not true. The com-mittee has an entire team that is very focused on and investigating what hap-pened with respect to security at the Capitol. And it is also the case, though, Madam Speaker, we must all remember that the former President provoked a violent assault on this body, and the extent to which there were security lapses, the extent to which people did not anticipate that there would be a violent assault on the Capitol, pro-voked by the former President, is not the fault of the Capitol Police. That is the responsibility of the former Presi-dent. And I would also note, Madam Speaker, that Mr. DAVIS voted ‘‘yes’’ on the bipartisan commission when it came up.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN ), my good friend and colleague. Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I want to underscore first the point that was just made by Ms. CHENEY . The distinguished ranking member of the House Administration Committee was ap-pointed to this committee, or the ap-pointment was accepted by Speaker PELOSI , but it was withdrawn by the minority leader. It was not rejected by the majority; it was rejected by the mi-nority. Madam Speaker, we are here in the broadest sense to defend American democratic institutions and the rule of law. And our colleague said before that if this investigation were valid, then we would be talking to officials from the Sergeant at Arms Office and the National Guard. Well, I have got good news for my friends. First, every court that has looked at their claim that this is an in-valid investigation either because of its composition or because it was in-trinsically flawed in its pursuit of the facts about January 6, has rejected those arguments. Every court that looked at it has rejected the precise ar-guments our colleagues are floating on the floor today. But I will go even further than that. We have, in fact, interviewed precisely the people that they set up as a test for the validity of our investigation from the Sergeant at Arms and the National Guard. And as patriotic public officials living out their oaths of office and not bowing down to the humiliating cult of Donald Trump, they didn’t need a sub-poena from this committee; they came voluntarily. They not only understood their legal duty to testify, a duty our colleagues, like my friend, the gen-tleman from Ohio, clearly understands when they wield the gavel, but they have come forward and said that it is a patriotic honor for them. It is not just a legal duty, it is a patriotic honor for them to render truthful testimony on this horrific attack against America, which interrupted the counting of elec-toral college votes for the first time in American history. b1745 This is mandated in the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, which says that the House and the Senate must meet in joint session in order to count electoral college votes the first week of January, on the Wednesday following a Presidential election. What is remarkable to me is that the caucus that is now so drenched in the Trump-Putin propaganda is not just trying to denounce the Democrats for searching the truth right now. Today, they have begun the utterly cannibal-istic process of vilifying and casti-gating Republicans just because they disagree with the orthodoxy, the dogma handed down by Donald Trump. Ms. CHENEY is the former chair of the House Republican Conference, and it is left to Democrats to defend her against the vilification and the castigating that we hear. \n",

      "Ms. CHENEY. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. RASKIN. It is up to us to defend Mr. KINZINGER and to defend Ms. C HENEY, because if you don’t go along with what Donald Trump says, if you don’t act like you are a robot, or a member of a religious cult, they will attack you, they will vilify you, they will de-nounce you. These people, Mr. KINZINGER and Ms. CHENEY , are constitutional heroes, and they don’t deserve your contempt. The insurrectionists and the lawbreakers deserve your contempt because they are acting in contempt of the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. JACKSON ). Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for the time. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about two great patriots who I am proud to call my friends, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. These two men have served our country honor-ably. Sadly, they are now targets of the political witch hunt simply because they served our country and they are loyal to our great former President, Donald J. Trump. The illegitimate January 6th Committee’s ruthless crusade against President Trump and his close allies is yet another smear on this great body. It will go down in history as another failed attempt by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to bring down good people simply because they dis-agree with their political beliefs. As someone who has been a target of the left and their ruthless tactics in the past, I know firsthand how dam-aging this can be. The American people are tired of this partisan January 6 cir-cus. It is time to stop this nonsense now. I urge my colleagues to stand up against this charade and oppose this baseless resolution. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN ). Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The majority leader, just a few minutes ago said—used the term ‘‘danger to our democracy.’’ Danger to our de-mocracy. Think about this. Democrats have closed the Capitol, allowed proxy vot-ing, kicked Republicans off commit-tees, won’t let Republicans serve on this select committee—the first time in the history of the Congress the mi-nority leader was not allowed to put on a select committee the individuals he or she selected; first time in the his-tory of our Nation. The Democrats are trying to end the electoral college; trying to end the fili-buster; trying to pack the Court. This committee, the January 6th Committee, altered evidence and pre-sented it to the American people as if it were true. And they accuse us of being a danger to our democracy? Mr. GAETZ was right. We have got a border that is complete chaos. We have $6 gas in California, $4 gas everywhere else in the country. We have crime at record levels in every major urban area in this Nation. And we have an infla-tion problem that is at a 40-year high. And this committee has more contempt resolutions for a purely political reason. I think the whole committee is pure political, designed to do one thing; keep President Trump off the ballot in 2024. The gentlewoman from Wyoming, in her opening comments, used the term, ‘‘false message.’’ False message. She used to say big lie. Now I guess it is false message. When she said it, I start-ed jotting things down. Think about all the false messages we have got from them in the last few years. They told us the protests in the summer of 2020 were peaceful. We got a billion dollars’ worth of damage around our cities that says it wasn’t. They told us the dossier was real. They told us it was Republicans, Re-publicans who wanted to defund the po-lice. That one is almost laughable, if it wasn’t so serious for our law enforce-ment and for the families who live in those areas where mayors and city councils did defund the police. They told us the FBI didn’t spy on the Trump campaign. We know that wasn’t true. We have got inspectors general reports that tell us all kinds of things of what they did in front of the FISA Court. They said Trump colluded with Russia. We have got a Mueller report, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 30 million hard- earned American tax dollars in that re-port that said that false message was just that, false. They told us COVID didn’t start in the lab; sure looks like it did. They told us the lab wasn’t doing gain-of-function research; sure looks like it was. They told us the vaccinated can’t get it. We know that is wrong. Every day there is a new announcement: Member of Congress is getting it; fully vac-cinated, boosted, and everything else. They told us those who are vaccinated can’t transmit it. They told us that was wrong. And you talk about the biggest false message, the biggest false message that has just been confirmed in the last week, how false it was? The Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. The Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. October 22, 2020, 2 weeks before the election, Candidate Biden, in a debate,  is asked about his son’s business dealings with foreign companies. He says: ‘‘Nothing was unethical.’’ He said: My son has not made money with business interests—with companies with an in-terest in China. And we all know there are 4.8 million reasons why that statement was not accurate. And how do we know? Wash-ington Post told us. Not me, not Presi-dent Trump, not Republicans, The Washington Post told us last week, two stories last week, a week ago today, one at 11 a.m., one at 11:04 a.m.; two eight-page articles, 4 minutes apart, confirming what we knew, but what big media, big tech, Democrats colluded to keep from the American people just days before, just days before the most important election we have, the Presi-dential election, who is going to be our next Commander in Chief. The laptop was real. The eyewitness was real. The emails were real. The only thing fake was that collusion from those individuals, those entities to keep important information from we, the people, in the run-up to the most important election we have. And oh, by the way, they were joined by 51 former intel officials, joined in the collusion. You know what is also interesting? It is funny how that story has changed. Eighteen months ago, it started off, it wasn’t his laptop. It quickly switched to well, it was his laptop, but it was Russian disinformation. And now it is, well, it wasn’t Russian disinformation, but Joe Biden had nothing to do with it. Now it was, well, Joe knew what was going on, but he wasn’t really involved in anything wrong. Ron Klain told us that, the Chief of Staff told us that Sunday. We need to be focusing on the issues that the American people want us to focus on. You want to talk about dan-ger to our democracy and the biggest false message. I would say what hap-pened—one of the biggest dangers to our democracy and one of the biggest false messages is what happened 18 months ago, where that story was kept from the American people. We could dig into that, find out what went on there, why that happened. And we could also focus on the record crime, record inflation, record price of gas, and the chaos on our southern bor-der that is about to get worse. \n",

      "Mr. PANETTA ). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BANKS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. JORDAN. It is about to get worse as the Democrats look to—as the Biden administration looks to repeal title 42. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself the bal-ance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it might feel really good today for my opponents on the other side of the aisle. It might feel really good in a vindictive sort of way, to vote to put their political opponents behind bars. That might feel really good for my opponents across the aisle. But I guarantee you, the history will not look back kindly on those actions in the years to come. I guarantee it. It couldn’t be anymore un-American what they want to do today, to vote to put two men behind bars purely because they disagree with their politics and the man that they worked for. I can’t think of a bigger reason for my opponents to vote ‘‘no’’ on such an un-American resolution. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and do the same. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, it does not feel really good today. It feels sad, and it feels tragic that so many in my own party are refusing to address the constitu-tional crisis and the challenge that we face. The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee went to law school. I am not sure if he passed the bar. But he knows that we all have an obligation to abide by the rulings of the courts. So, yes, it was a false story. Yes, it was a big lie. In fact, former Vice President Pence has said that what President Trump wanted him to do was ‘‘un-American.’’ It was also unconsti-tutional, and it was illegal. Mr. Speaker, what gives me tremendous hope though is although so many in my party in this body have put loy-alty to Donald Trump ahead of their oath to the Constitution, the com-mittee has interviewed scores of Re-publicans from around the country who, in fact, have shown the kind of tremendous bravery and dedication to public service that every American can be proud of: Republicans who were ap-pointed by President Trump to posts in the Department of Justice; Repub-licans who stood firm; Republicans who threatened to resign and who refused to participate in President Trump’s ef-forts to corrupt the Department of Jus-tice with the stolen election lies—yes, lies—that led to January 6. We have heard from Republicans serving in State legislatures, in State and local governments who also stood firm. Mr. Speaker, it is crucially important that this body hold these gentle-men in contempt. It is crucially impor-tant that they have to abide by their subpoena. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, let me say for the record, if there is any Member on the other side who feels the strength to come and testify before our committee, I invite them, right now, to let us know and we will gladly entertain whatever information they have as to what hap-pened on January 6. Some of them ran out of this building fearing for their lives, so there is no question that something happened. And H. Res. 503 says, absolutely, we have to find the facts and cir-cumstances as to what happened and why and make recommendations; and that is what we have to do. We have the constitutional power to issue subpoenas. If people do not follow subpoenas, we have the right to bring them before this body and recommend contempt citations; and that is what we are doing today. So it doesn’t matter if they were a father, a mother, a sister, or a brother, had children; if they break the law, they break the law. No one is above the law, and that is the point we are trying to make. We asked the individuals, subpoenaed them to come before the committee, and they chose not to come and, there-fore, they broke the law, and that is why we are here today. So, Mr. Speaker, as I have mentioned, when I testified before the Rules Committee, it is absurd that there should be any disagreement at all about why we are here for this con-tempt resolution. If you listen to the arguments from some of my friends on the other side, they have very little to say of sub-stance of this matter. We hear excuses. We hear attacks about process. We hear scare-mongering about the select committee. Let me remind my colleagues, we have conducted over 830 interviews and depositions. And again, I invite any of them to come talk to us if they want to. Now, if, for some reason, they are reluctant or afraid, then I feel sorry for them. Our constitutional democracy was challenged on January 6. We have to fix this. Over 200 years, we have oper-ated in complete freedom, and all of a sudden, this institution was attacked; and we have to fix that. b1800 We are the number one democracy in the world, but we lead by example. Democrats are leading by example. The select committee is leading by example by bringing these two gentlemen who broke the law, who decided that it is better to deal with the law of Donald Trump rather than the Constitution of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, especially my friend from Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY ). Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support adoption of this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a simple, but sacred principle: No one is above the law. Peter Navarro was one of the former president’s closest allies. And, by his own admis-sion, played a direct role in planning and co-ordinating the events of January 6. He speaks  to that role on television, on podcasts, and even in his own book—yet he refuses to do so before Congress, even when compelled by a lawful subpoena. That is unjustifiable, and in light of the subpoena, a criminal form of con-tempt. Dan Scavino was similarly close to the former president—and similarly involved in the events leading up to and on January 6. Mr. Scavino played an intimate role in crafting former President Trump’s social media strat-egy and served as his Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications. And, like Mr. Navarro, he was called before our committee because our evidence and public reporting, suggests he possesses direct, personal knowledge of the events leading up to January 6, and while the Capitol was under siege. Unfortunately, both Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino have chosen at every turn to obstruct, to conceal their knowledge, forgoing their legal duty to comply with a congressional subpoena and attempting instead to hide behind spu-rious claims of privilege. But let me be clear: There is no privilege that allows a witness to simply refuse to ap-pear. President Biden has declined to assert any privilege and properly concluded that the national interests in hearing the testimony of Navarro and Scavino clearly outweigh any other consideration. And there is certainly no privilege that allows a witness to refuse to ap-pear before Congress while sitting for press interviews or discussing the matter in a book. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution. To do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent: That Congress is not a body that is capable of, or willing to, carry out meaningful oversight. That our subpoenas can be shrugged off or ignored. And that the American people can no longer have faith in our ability to investigate potential abuses of power by any president—past, present, or fu-ture. As Judge Carter said last week in his ruling, ‘If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those respon-sible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.’ He is right. We must commit to the pur-suit of accountability and justice. Not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans who love and cherish our democracy. And I will take just one more moment to urge the Department of Justice to act with all due haste when they receive the criminal con-tempt referrals for Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro. And not just with respect to these re-ferrals, but on any evidence of criminality con-nected to efforts to overturn the election. The rule of law must apply equally to all Ameri-cans, including former presidents. To do other-wise, risks another repetition of January 6th— or worse. \n",

Originally from Chesterfield County, Officer Sutton graduated from the po-lice academy earlier this year, and he was training to serve in the Henrico County PD’s patrol bureau. He was also soon to be married. Last week, Officer Sutton’s life was cut tragically short in a car crash dur-ing field training. In an instant, Virginia lost one of our best, someone who demonstrated both bravery and com-passion through his actions. We will remember Officer Sutton for his service to our community. We will remember his commitment to our Commonwealth. And we will remember his story as one of purpose and inspira-tion for our country. In the words of the ‘‘Hero’s Welcome’’: ‘‘And through your selfless ac-tions, others will hear the call.’’ My prayers are with Officer Sutton’s fellow officers in the Henrico County Police Department, his classmates at the academy, his fiance, Zoe, and all of his loved ones.

Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States of America, the most prosperous country in the world, has warned the American people that a food shortage is a real possi-bility in our near future. Much like our national energy shortage, this potential crisis has been made much more likely by President Biden’s out-of-control spending and his unwill-ingness to tap into American re-sources, ingenuity, and its people. Since January of 2021, the prices of many of the key inputs used to produce our Nation’s food supply have substan-tially increased. Ammonia is up 203 percent; liquid nitrogen is up 162 per-cent; and farm diesel, used in almost every piece of farm equipment, is up a whopping 95 percent. Spending more money won’t fix this; in fact, it has made it worse by causing the prices of everything to go up. If a food shortage does come to the United States, the sole person to blame will be President Biden, who has wast-ed no time spending our country into a crisis. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable achieve-ment of Petit Jean Meats, marking 100 years of business in central Arkansas. Petit Jean Meats was established in 1922 by the late Felix Schlosser, search-ing for a better opportunity after es-caping an inflation-ravaged Germany. He found that opportunity in Morrilton, Arkansas, and opened a small retail market, which has now ex-panded into a 48,000-square foot proc-essing plant. The story of Petit Jean Meats is truly inspirational, and today, it is still owned by that same family. Current owner David Ruff says: ‘‘We still do things the old-fashioned way, which gives our meats that old-fash-ioned flavor.’’ I commend Petit Jean Meats for this outstanding achievement, and I wish them continued success. \n",

Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight outraged over the systemic slaughter of Ukrainian children by Russian murderer Vladimir Putin. Countless Ukrainian children are being murdered and orphaned. An en-tire generation is watching as every-thing around them is destroyed by Rus-sia’s war machine. Fathers and mothers are being ripped from sons and daughters. The littlest are being left to fend for themselves, as Russia lays waste to everything Ukrainians have ever known. No little child should be left to weep next to the unmarked grave of their parent that they will never see again. No child should have to ponder how they will eat or where they will sleep due to the actions of a tyrant who de-rives satisfaction from their despair. We have a global responsibility to end this bloodshed. Fully arm Ukraine now. Isolate Russia from the commu-nity of responsible nations. Starve Putin and his oligarchs. Make sure that we help Ukraine withstand all that they must in order to win this war against Russia’s killing machine. Let all democratic nations do everything they can to assure liberty in Ukraine is victorious.  DISASTER AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER (Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to educate my colleagues and the pub-lic one more time as to what sort of disaster we are soon to have on the southern border. Recently, we have had frequently 90,000 to 100,000 people cross the border every month. People of whom we know little. People are skipping to the head of the line over people who want to come here legally, people that come from countries that are hostile to us. But as bad as it is to have 80,000 to 100,000 people come across, the Biden administration is claiming that within the next month and a half they will re-move title 42, opening up the border to perhaps another 200,000 or 300,000 or 400,000 people a month above what we are already getting here. I personally think they are doing this because the Ukraine war is going on, and they think they can really land a death blow to the future of this coun-try by opening up the border to people all over the world. I call upon American citizens and my colleagues to not forget about what is going on at the border. I call upon the press to treat this story with the grav-ity it should be given and to report on all the people who are going to come here in the second half of May. We cannot have 400,000 people a month coming across the border. \n",

      "Ms. DEAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, while preparing remarks, I considered showing much more graphic photos of Ukrain-ian children brutalized at the hands of Vladimir Putin. But then I thought of some of the people who might see this—refugees of war, war veterans who would be reminded of their own pain and suffering. The truth is, for survivors who actually see the end to war, the trauma never recedes, it never leaves. The cost of war is simply too high. I come to the floor tonight not as a Congresswoman, but as a mother and a grandmother. My heart breaks at these sights of horror of children lost or scarred forever. Last night, my son sent me a photo of a child who is nearly the same age as his daughter, my granddaughter. On her back, her mother had written her name, her contact information, her birth date in case the mother was killed, or the daughter was left alone. I cannot imagine that planning—the fear, the despair, the trauma. No matter the war, we must think of the children in Syria, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Cameroon, anywhere on our planet. I pray for peace for anyone suffering at the hands of a brutal dictator. We must do everything we can to find a peaceful resolution. ‘‘Slava Ukrani,’’ ‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ ‘‘Slava heroem,’’ ‘‘Glory to the he-roes.’’ \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I will start with associating myself with my colleagues who have just spoken and say, ‘‘Glory to Ukraine’’ and to in-dicate that my heart is broken. The words will not elevate the despicable actions of Vladimir Putin. Today we voted to secure and seek, I hope, an indictment. He is a war crimi-nal, and he is killing children. But I must, Mr. Speaker, suggest that we have a difficult problem at the border exacerbated by Governor Greg Abbott, who wishes to make a mockery of the desperate people coming, includ-ing Ukrainian refugees, who gather at the southern border. Today, he has an-nounced that he will bus these mi-grants to Washington, D.C. I am embarrassed. With the likes of George H.W. Bush, Ann Richards, Henry B. Gonzalez, as well as Barbara Jordan, who are broth-ers and sisters of Texas, I now have to live with Governor Greg Abbott who disgraces us by suggesting that we must take migrants and drop them off on the steps of the Capitol. I welcome them. Why don’t we sit down and resolve how we deal with these desperate peo-ple? Why don’t we find a way, as we were trying to do with George W. Bush, to have an immigration policy? But when he does that, he will also do that to Ukrainian refugees at the southern border. Enough is enough. \n",

      "Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, during the last election, the Democratic Party managed to win a razor-thin majority here in this House and a split Senate, 50–50. No objective person can look at those numbers and suggest that the President of this party, President Biden, was given any kind of authority whatsoever to try to radically transform our country, but, you know, that is exactly what he has tried to do for the worse. And the latest offense, the latest overstep, the latest overreach is this President has made the most leftwing nomination to the Supreme Court in American history. For those who didn’t see this over the weekend, Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-son testified in her post-confirmation hearing written questions for the record: ‘‘I do not hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights.’’ You heard that correctly. President Biden’s nominee for the highest court in this land cannot say whether indi-viduals possess natural rights. We can hardly imagine a more un-American position than denying the first self-evi-dent truth of America. The central and foundational premise of our great country is that all individ-uals are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among those are the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We have a newsflash for the judge: Those rights don’t come from govern-ment; they don’t come from any human authority. They come from our creator himself. We are endowed with those rights by God. The fact that Judge Jackson cannot or will not acknowledge this simple fact is disqualifying for the highest court in this land, period, full stop. Mr. Speaker, the President’s nomination is truly out of step with the coun-try and this fateful moment. And the primary job Americans elected President Biden to do was to help unite this country. This is doing the opposite. His nomination for the Supreme Court is the latest example of just how badly he has failed. I am very thankful to my colleagues for joining me on the floor this evening to discuss President Biden’s radical nominee to the United States Supreme Court, but also, as you will hear, the myriad number of other crises the White House is creating at home and abroad. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER ). b1930 Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, title 42 is the only thing keeping President Biden from fully handing our border to cartels and smugglers al-ready taking full advantage of his in-competence and neglect. Last week, the Biden administration announced that they will be stopping Border Patrol from enforcing COVID–19 restrictions on illegal immigrants by ending title 42. Title 42 must stay in place. It is a matter of national security, and my colleagues and I are calling on Demo-crats to act in a bipartisan effort to  force a vote on the bill to keep it in place. Biden’s open border policies are an unmitigated disaster. The crisis at our southern border is out of control and our Customs and Border Patrol is al-ready dangerously overwhelmed. Ending title 42 expulsions will signal to cartels and migrants that our border is now wide open, inciting more vio-lence and lawlessness. It is also being reported that the Biden administration is going to divert resources from our veterans in order to give free medical care to illegal mi-grants. I wrote a letter to the secretary of Veterans Affairs to oppose these efforts because we must put our heroes first and stand up for our veterans. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for drawing attention to that. The gentle-woman is exactly right, and some of the Border Patrol officials have said that they estimate that by rescinding title 42, that the number of illegal bor-der crossings will double overnight. So instead of having 7,000 a day, we will go to 18, 20,000 a day. The numbers are just staggering. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT ). Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to the great State of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, a recent CNBC survey illustrates how Americans are feeling about inflation. Fifty-two percent of adults reported they are under more fi-nancial stress today than they were 1 year ago. The poll also shows how consumers spending habits changed over the last 6 months in response to rising prices: Fifty-three percent say they are cut-ting back on dining out; 39 percent are driving less; 32 percent switched from a brand-name product; and 29 percent canceled a vacation. The economy is in a tailspin, Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Biden’s Big Government agenda. His failed policies are making the cost of doing business more expensive, and those in-creased costs are passed directly on to consumers. Many companies use catchy slogans and taglines to advertise their services but, in this economy, some businesses might rethink their marketing cam-paigns. Remember the $5 foot-long at Subway? It costs at least $10 for a foot- long sandwich from Subway these days, Mr. Speaker. Southwest Airlines’ low-cost flight motto is ‘‘Wanna Get Away?’’ Flights are now so expensive; Southwest should change its offers to Wanna Go One Way? Did you catch that? One way, since that is all travelers obvi-ously can afford. Walmart tells customers they will ‘‘Save Money, Live Better’’ by shop-ping at its stores. Americans are prob-ably thinking more along the line of Spend Money, Live Worse after making a trip to Walmart in recent weeks. Finally, Mr. Speaker, lots of folks are doing their banking with Capital One, which asks ‘‘What’s in Your Wal-let?’’ Pretty soon Capital One will be asking consumers What’s Left in Your Wallet?’’ Thanks to rising prices. Mr. Speaker, Americans are really just fed up with President Biden’s han-dling of the economy. From the same CNBC poll I referenced earlier, 61 per-cent disapprove of the President’s re-sponse to inflation, and 81 percent fear a recession is coming in 2022. And I would dare say, CNBC is not the most conservative folks out there. Earlier this week, thank goodness, Elon Musk, he swooped into Twitter to save the company from the woke poli-tics that are running it into the ground, censorship being one of those. President Biden needs a similar hero who can come in and stop this adminis-tration from destroying the economy. Alternatively, he could simply give up on his Big Government agenda that is failing American citizens, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate Vice Chairman JOHNSON’s lackluster leadership and his constant mention of complimentary snacks which are not here, coming forthwith. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend; we always need a little moment of brevity, don’t we? The news is so bad, but the gen-tleman pointed out and highlighted how difficult the times are, and that is a serious subject. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield next to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN ), who holds the distinction of being the highest-ranking mili-tary officer ever elected to the United States Congress, my classmate, presi-dent of our freshman class. I still call him the general. Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague from Louisiana, who I rely on. If you are going to be worth anything as a military com-mander, you rely on the folks who work for you. And I can tell you, I spent a lot of time with lawyers, and the gentleman is the best when it comes to constitutional law. So I am proud to be here with him today to talk about kind of a certain level of, you could say, lawlessness. President Biden’s favorite policy, public policy shop, also known as the CDC, announced that it would lift title 42, which has been used nearly 2 mil-lion times since March of 2020, to re-move illegal immigrants. When title 42 is lifted this May, even more illegal immigrants will be incentivized to cross our southern bor-der. This will spark an unprecedented surge, considering that we have al-ready experienced record-high illegal border crossings under President Biden in his first year plus. As border violations rise, so does the number of violent criminals allowed into our communities. I regret these circumstances forced upon our Nation by President Biden’s careless policies. Because of this, we must be prepared for more illegal immigrant crime. For this reason, I will be introducing legislation next week called the Vic-tims of Immigration Crime Engage-ment Restoration Act, or the VOICE Restoration Act. VOICE was an office set up by President Trump to connect victims of ille-gal immigrant crimes; connect them to their legal representatives, to any wit-nesses, with supportive resources like a hotline to answer questions, local con-tacts, Social Services referrals, and in-formation about the custody status of detained illegal immigrants. In 2021, President Biden dismantled VOICE—I repeat, dismantled VOICE. Think, for a second, what that says about him and his policies, and what he thinks about innocent American citi-zens. My legislation will permanently reinstate the VOICE office, and I look for-ward to sharing more of the details soon. We have an out-of-control crisis on our southern border; predictable and avoidable, but it is so massive that it is impacting cities and towns all across our country. The Democrat leadership in Congress and in the White House have done nothing about this. This must change soon. And I know it is going to change here in probably about another 8 months, because we are going to have some new leadership. And my promise to you, as a marine who doesn’t know the word ‘‘quit,’’ is that, in the meantime, every day be-tween now and then, I won’t stop fight-ing, along with others, to secure our borders. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that fight and that very worthwhile legislation, and we look forward to see-ing that. The gentleman is right. The surge in crime is directly related to border in so many ways because we know dangerous people have come across that border. It is completely open to MS–13 gang members, violent criminals, convicted persons, criminals who come from other countries. You have child preda-tors, even terrorists who have come across that border. We know this for a fact, and still they won’t change the policies. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to the gentleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA .) Mr. L AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, President Biden recently announced his fis-cal year 2023 budget, the proposal in-cludes a plan to spend $73 trillion in a 10-year period that will add $15 trillion to our national debt; this at a time when government spending is already driving inflation and making all these items that much more expensive: Air-line fares, lodging, gas, the cost of automobiles, new or used. I stopped in at a dealer the other day and they are finding that people are ac-tually willing to pay more for a used  car than what the car cost new, or trucks. It is crazy. So the American people are suffering right now under these economic condi-tions, all man-caused, all government- caused, pretty much. So with record-breaking inflation and gas prices, we are, instead, having a budget that is crafted to not combat these issues, but add to them. It radicalizes our energy in the new Green Deal that these guys want to do, mak-ing more cost, making energy even less available to Americans. It includes zero mention of resuming the Keystone Pipeline, since that was something on the first day of office they decided to put a stop to. The budget should be focused on getting people back to work, to making America thrive, combating inflation, not causing it; strengthening our en-ergy independence, which will bring prices down, not playing around with the strategic reserve and, you know, bleeding out a million barrels per day. That strategic reserve has a purpose, and it isn’t playing economics with it; it is supposed to be there for, indeed, a time of crisis for our country. So, instead of relying on Russian oil and relying on other imported oil from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, whoever, we can do our own national oil independ-ence with our own known reserves. So, the direction the Biden administration is taking with all this spend-ing, it is starting to mimic my home State of California really, because our regulatory and tax policies there are already the model for what not to do. The Federal Government shouldn’t fol-low that. So let’s come back to common sense. I urge President Biden and the Demo-crats to not adopt this giant spending plan but move in a direction of getting people back into production again. Come out of this COVID crisis, put them back to work, have our economy thrive, with our energy independence, food independence, because California’s ag situation is being decimated by the water being taken away. I asked the President to help us on this. Help us grow food in this country and get prices back down and not have empty shelves. That should be focus of how you help American people, not more crazy spending. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. So much of that is just common sense, and I appreciate him pointing it out. But sadly, unfortunately, this White House shows no intention whatsoever of reversing its policies and positions, which could fix these problems. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to yield next to the gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate my good friend from my neighbor, Louisiana, Mr. JOHNSON , for having this Special Order. No, it doesn’t look like things are going to change, as the gentleman said. Joe Biden has no interest in securing the southern border. He has proven it time and time again over the last 14 months. On day one of his Presidency, our Commander in Chief stopped com-pletely the construction of our border wall, which is, by the way, something that Congress appropriated funds for and is something that we know for a fact deters illegal crossings. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security reported that illegal entries in areas with the new border wall sys-tem along the Yuma sector plummeted more than 87 percent in fiscal year 2020, compared with the previous year of 2019. President Biden’s foolish decision to stop construction of this wall left mil-lions of taxpayer dollars’ worth of steel just rusting away in the hot sun and the cold, wet winters; millions of your tax dollars simply gone to waste. He ended remain in Mexico, a policy that The Washington Post reported made illegal apprehensions fall by 30 percent in its very first year alone. He has tied the hands of ICE who, last year, deported the lowest number of illegal aliens since 1995, despite more than 2 million alien apprehensions. In-terior enforcement is drying up to nothing. And now he is scrapping title 42, the very last policy that saves CBP from drowning in a complete sea of chaos. But if all of this isn’t enough to convince you that Joe Biden doesn’t have your best interests in mind, take a look at his budget request for 2023. He wants $73 trillion—that is with a T—in spending, $58 trillion—another T—more in taxes. And our debt will increase by $16 trillion—with a T—over the next decade. I did a quick search for the phrase ‘‘border security’’ in this budget. It is mentioned twice. We are facing the worst border crisis on record and a his-toric number of fentanyl overdoses from drugs illegally smuggled into our country, over 100,000 dead Americans from drug overdoses, and yet, the President mentioned border security only twice. Do you know how often he mentions the word ‘‘climate’’? 187 times. Joe Biden claims that he is working to protect America but, folks, the facts actually say otherwise. The facts show that he doesn’t care about keeping you and your family safe. The facts show he doesn’t care about protecting the live-lihood that you worked so hard for. And the facts show that he doesn’t care about the sovereignty or the security of our great Nation that we love, a bea-con of liberty and freedom for all the world to look at and envy. That is why they are coming here. Shame on President Biden. b1945 Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, John Adams said facts are stubborn things, and those are some tough facts. They cannot refute it be-cause everyone can see for themselves. By the way, Dr. Babin, I just pulled up the U.S. debt clock, this thing that everybody can see on their smartphone. Currently, right now, as we stand here, the national debt is $30,367,412,900. You can’t count it or fol-low it with the naked eye. Unbeliev-able. And he is proposing more. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE ). Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate your leadership and willing-ness to highlight the issues facing our country, including the very serious issue of the possible confirmation of an unqualified person, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the U.S. Supreme Court. President Biden’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-son, commonly known as KBJ, is sim-ply unfit to serve our Nation’s highest court. Throughout her legal career, Judge Jackson has garnered a disconcerting record of being soft on crime, as evi-denced by her lenient sentencing, par-ticularly for criminals convicted of egregious acts involving child sex tor-ture. Judge Jackson simply is incapa-ble of holding dangerous criminals ac-countable. Additionally, Judge KBJ has revealed her allegiance to the radical left by re-fusing to define what a woman is, ex-cusing her extremism by claiming she isn’t a biologist. There are indisputable differences between men and women, and those differences must be both ac-knowledged and accepted in order for KBJ to properly adjudicate title IX cases. Judge Jackson also recently declined to recognize Americans’ natural rights, the precious rights granted to us by God. Failing to accept the basic prin-ciple that individuals possess unalienable rights, a principle that is the very foundation of our American values, is supremely disqualifying for any individual seeking to serve our Na-tion’s highest court. Yet, despite Judge Jackson’s frightening record and recent disqualifying revelations, the Senate intends to vote to potentially confirm her to the Su-preme Court this week. While it is true that Judge Jackson’s confirmation will not immediately alter the makeup of the Court, it is naive and cowardly to make excuses when the stakes are this high. Our country, our liberties, and the makeup of the Supreme Court are on the line. If Judge Jackson becomes a Supreme Court Justice, she will serve for dec-ades, solidifying and strengthening the left’s menacing grip of our rule of law. Her decisions will impact future Amer-icans for generations to come, setting precedent that will ultimately guide our great Nation once many of us in these Chambers are long gone. This is exactly why Judge Jackson’s confirmation is much larger than just one vote. It is about preserving justice, protecting our freedoms, and defending our Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge every solitary Senator to contemplate their vote and the significant weight that it carries for our future. I encourage them to vote ‘‘no’’ on this confirmation. Without question, Americans from Maine to Utah to Alaska, from sea to shining sea, are watching intently, praying their Senators’ votes will rep-resent our Nation’s constitutional principles rather than appeasement to the left. America is watching. Will our Senators defend America by voting ‘‘no,’’ or will they shrink back? We will not forget. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for high-lighting that. It is a serious issue. The longest-lasting legacy of any President is who they put on those Federal courts, and, of course, the most important is the highest court in the land. We cannot overstate how im-portant this is. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my good friend. Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for hosting this Special Order tonight. Mr. Speaker, President Biden’s budget is symbolic of his wasteful build back broke agenda that was filled with partisan provisions. There is $73 trillion in new spending, $58 trillion in taxes, and $16 trillion in new debt, all over the next 10 years. When hardworking Tennesseans get together and come up with a household budget, they have difficult conversa-tions with one another about what ex-actly they can afford. If something falls under the category of unnecessary and unaffordable, the last thing they do is put it on their grandchildren’s credit cards. That is exactly what this budget does. President Biden and congressional Democrats praising his proposal are now on record seeming to have no issue with mortgaging our country and its children’s futures, even amidst the largest increase in inflation since 1982. There are many wasteful provisions in President Biden’s budget proposal, like the $11 billion being sent to for-eign developing countries to help adapt to global warming. The one that I struggle with the most is the one that gives $400 million to Planned Parent-hood and other entities that perform abortions. The Hyde amendment has existed in every Federal appropriations bill since 1976. It is one of the most longstanding and bipartisan agreements to protect Federal taxpayer dollars from going to-ward abortion. President Biden’s decision to purposefully keep this out of his budget proposal is wrong and will never get my support nor the support of my con-stituents in middle Tennessee who are firmly pro-life. Leaving out the Hyde amendment is only another partisan attempt to ad-vertise the President’s anti-life posi-tion and satisfy those who support the horrible atrocities of abortion. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the Congress to stand firm in their commitment to protecting life. We must restore the Hyde amendment and reject President Biden’s budget be-cause no Tennessean’s tax dollars, nor dollars borrowed from our children and grandchildren, should go toward sub-sidizing Planned Parenthood and the immoral practice of abortion. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, that was so well said. I appre-ciate the gentleman highlighting that issue. It is one of so many that we have deep concerns about with this adminis-tration and their budget and every-thing they do. We have to protect the sanctity of every single human life. To defend the defenseless is the job that we have—the first job, the primary job. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, our country is obviously in bad shape, and I think our forefathers, if they saw the way we operated today, would be quite stunned and wonder where in their Constitution they let us down to wind up where we are today. I think of the three branches of government. The judiciary is the one which right now has let down the Framers the most. Our forefathers re-alized that a country with elections usually eventually fails because the majority can either want, or be manip-ulated into wanting, more stuff, or or-dering other people around to order them to be obeyed the way they would like other people to be behaved. The Bill of Rights is almost exclusively about restricting the role of gov-ernment in American life. Obviously, the Supreme Court has largely aban-doned that function. Things got bad in the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 1960s. Today, one wonders what the Court will ever say no to. Where will Judge Jackson fit as we try to defend our Constitution? We look at her inability to say what a woman is and her inability to talk about judicial philosophy, and we know where she will stand. She stands with woke America. I hate that word, but that is what it is. It is somebody who has no respect for tradition. If you have no respect for tradition or com-mon sense, you certainly don’t have that near reverence, which should be a requirement for any Supreme Court Justice. Furthermore, President Biden got himself in a position in which he said he is going to have to promote a Black woman to that position. The very idea that you think decisions on a court should vary with the background of the person who is on that court shows you don’t have that respect for the Con-stitution. All Americans should have an originalist view of the Constitution and consider it the great, almost God- given, document that it is. In any event, when you don’t have that respect for the Constitution, you know you are not going to respect the Second Amendment. You are not going to respect the 10th Amendment; it is a disaster we have ignored it. You are going to continue to stretch the Com-merce Clause all out of whack. You are going to look at every individual as a member of a group, never as an indi-vidual in their own right. Right now, about 2 percent of the lawyers in the country are Black women. So, what Joe Biden did is he took 98 percent of the possible resumes for this very important job and threw them in the garbage. I wonder if President Biden does that anywhere else in his life? Does he throw away 98 percent of the resumes or potential resumes when he is look-ing for a new dentist, a new plumber, a new clergyman, throw out 98 percent willy-nilly? That is what he has done in picking a new Supreme Court Jus-tice who could well be on the Court for the next 40 years. Our forefathers felt that by giving us this Constitution—they pointed out that this Constitution is fit for moral and religious people and not fit for anyone else. Will Judge Jackson re-spect that? I don’t know. When they finished the Constitution, Benjamin Franklin said: We are giving you a republic, if you can keep it. We are, right now, being tested whether we are the moral and religious people that can keep the republic that the forefathers felt they described in the Constitution. It looks to me, from everything you hear about her, that Judge Jackson is not going to have that reverence to keep that Constitution, to keep that republic. We will, therefore, with judges like that, wind up collapsing. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of wisdom there. The gentleman is exactly right. If a judge begins with the premise that we have no natural rights, that does not bode well for where that logic leads. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER ). Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, many times, we have heard President Biden and his administration say that the crisis we are facing at our southern border is seasonal. There is nothing seasonal about 1 million illegal aliens crossing our southern border in 6 months. There is nothing seasonal about 400,000 illegal alien got-aways going undetected into our country. The crisis at our southern border is the direct result of President Biden overturning successful policies put in place by Donald Trump. First, Biden halted the construction of the border wall. Then, he rescinded the remain in Mexico policy. Now, he is taking aim at one of the final remain-ing Trump policies, title 42, which al-lows law enforcement to expel illegal aliens who pose a health risk. The Department of Homeland Security predicts that as many as 12,000 to  18,000 illegal aliens will cross our southern border per day if title 42 is lifted—18,000 illegal aliens in 1 day. In 3 days, that would be greater than the population of Pennsylvania’s capital city, Harrisburg—in less than 3 days. In a little more than a day, it would be greater than the population of Wil-liamsport, Pennsylvania, the largest city in Pennsylvania’s 12th Congres-sional District. If President Biden removes title 42, it goes beyond bad judgment. It is reck-less, and it will turn the crisis into chaos at our southern border. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. KELLER for that. These words are not hyperbole. This is what the experts are saying. Customs and Border Patrol agents, those offi-cials who are there every day watching this chaos, this calamity that has de-veloped, they are the ones that are giv-ing us these numbers. They project 18,000 illegals a day. It is just hard to wrap your mind around that. b2000 Mr. KELLER. That is the executive branch, homeland security. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Absolutely. And these are the results of pol-icy choices, and they could easily be reversed if the White House would wake up and do something. So I thank the gentleman for bringing that to our attention tonight. Mr. Speaker, you have heard Members from across the country—north, south, east, and west—who have ex-pressed their outrage and their concern with all of the terrible policy choices that are leading to absurd results for our country. These are very dangerous times. There is no leadership in the White House. There is no leadership in the administration. There is no leader-ship from the Democratic majority in this House or in the split Senate down the Hall. We can turn these things around, and we can stop these crises if we make different decisions, but they will not do it. Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for my colleagues who have shown up tonight to articulate this for the American people. We can’t say it often enough or loudly enough. There is going to be a sea change in November, and we pray that we can hold on and keep this Republic until then. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. KELLY ) for 30 minutes. Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address some of the biggest problems facing the United States today and, quite frankly, the world. As the war between Russia and Ukraine wages on, many Americans have been quickly reminded of just how global our economy really is. Now, prior to the war, Russia provided the United States with 8 percent of our Nation’s oil and refined prod-ucts. A war involving Russia can sud-denly spike fuel prices at your local gas station. Like many nationwide, drivers in my home district of western Pennsylvania have seen gasoline at over $4 a gallon for well over a month. The interruption of our Nation’s oil supply and subsequent skyrocketing prices are just the latest reminder that we need to refocus our energy policies in Washington and produce more en-ergy right here at home in America. Let’s go back to May 2021, when two things happened: the United States im-ported a record amount of Russian oil, and President Biden waived sanctions on Nord Stream 2. That is the Russian natural gas pipeline set to supply much of Europe with energy. Now, 4 months earlier the President canceled the Keystone XL pipeline be-tween the United States and Canada. That pipeline would have delivered an additional 830,000 barrels of crude oil a day. That is 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day. That would have gone to U.S. refineries, and it would have created thou-sands and thousands of jobs. That is more oil than the United States im-ports from Russia each day. This is a no-brainer. Just bring back the pipe-line. It is so easy to do and so easy to institute. Why would we not do that? Why would we not be energy independent? We can’t depend on bad foreign actors such as Russia, Venezuela, or Iran to help provide our Nation’s energy. Above all I applaud the collective ef-fort right here in Washington to stop bankrolling the Russian war machine by buying their products. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, revenue from the energy sector is responsible for more than 40 percent of Russia’s federal budget. Some quick, back-of-the-envelope math, the 8 percent of Russian oil we imported equates to 672,000 barrels of oil per day. But this moment calls for a broader push to end our reliance on foreign en-ergy sources. To start, President Biden should reverse his executive order banning the Keystone pipeline. Next, we must return to Trump-era energy policies that made the U.S. en-ergy independent. To amend the former President’s famous tag line, let’s change it to make North America great again. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 61 percent of U.S. crude oil imports come from Can-ada. Another 11 percent comes from Mexico. Seventy-two percent comes from our neighbors to the north and our neighbors to the south. We should be expanding oil imports from our allies and neighbors rather than paying our adversaries who can hold our energy sector hostage. Doing so not only makes economic sense, but it improves relations with those closest to us and further strengthens our na-tional security by becoming less de-pendent on bullies like Russia, Ven-ezuela, and Iran. Now, on the other hand, President Biden has single-handedly made Ameri-cans poorer and our Nation’s security weaker during his first year in office. His anti-fossil fuel, Green New Deal wish list has placed unnecessary bur-dens on the oil and gas industry. Even as gas prices are reaching record highs here nationwide, just last month President Biden had announced that he is pausing decisions about new Federal oil and gas drilling as part of his plan to tackle climate change. And that is just the beginning. So far, President Biden has announced the release of 80 million bar-rels of oil from the Nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Just last week President Biden announced he will re-lease up to another 180 million barrels of oil over the next 6 months in an ef-fort to drive down gas prices. That doesn’t drive down gas prices. That theory really sounds good, but, Mr. Speaker, I want you to think about where that oil is coming from. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to be used in times of a national emergency when we don’t have a supply. It is not used to just try and rack up some cheap political points by saying: I am doing this so you won’t have to pay that much at the pump. It is not working. It never will work. Now, on November 23, the administration released 50 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Ac-cording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of gas dropped by a whopping 2 cents. In following days, by December 6, it dropped another 3 cents. So we saved a nickel, but we attacked our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Now, as of March 25 the reserve supply was 568 million barrels, meaning that President Biden is ready to take one-third of our Nation’s reserve and use them for his short-term political gain that has already proven to not lower gas prices for America but has weakened the reserve. Now, keep in mind, the purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to counter severe supply chain disrup-tions and enhance national security. It is not to make your polls look better, Mr. President. The 80 million barrels the President previously released are worth only about 4 days of U.S. oil consumption. Only the President can decide to with-draw oil from or refill the reserve. What is even more frightening so far is China has hardly tapped their oil re-serves. President Biden’s shortsighted decision-making is dangerously harm-ing our national security.  Now, I am proud to represent the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, a place once deemed and called the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. Pennsyl-vania produces 21 percent of the nat-ural gas extracted in the United States. That is second only to Texas, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2020, the Energy Information Administration adds that U.S. dry nat-ural gas production was about 10 per-cent greater than U.S. total natural gas consumption. That means we can export natural gas that we produce cre-ating energy security for other na-tions, notably our European allies who are currently dependent on Russia for their natural gas, and it forges a stronger foreign policy in the process. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the spike in fuel costs go hand in hand with American foreign policy. If we are dependent on bad actors for energy, then we are subjecting ourselves to their demands. But if we can supply the world with affordable energy, then we can strengthen our international ties and reinforce relationships instead of falling behind. Most importantly, we give the American people a greater sense of security that Russia so des-perately seeks to have only for itself. On the topic of foreign policy, Mr. Speaker, I want to quote a great fellow Pennsylvanian, Benjamin Franklin, who said: ‘‘By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.’’ Now, I have thought an awful lot about our Founding Father’s words as we watched current events unfold around the world. So much of what we are seeing right now mirrors itself in history. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a stark reminder that bul-lies like Vladimir Putin will stop at nothing to achieve their end game to upend democracy and freedom while chilling all the opposition in the proc-ess. This type of takeover carries a precedent. Putin’s quest to conquer Ukraine should remind all of us of what hap-pened in the 1930s and 1940s when Ad-olph Hitler began a similar pursuit across Europe. Now, for far too long the free world watched from the side-lines hoping that European forces could prevent further escalation only to find that Hitler and the Axis Powers were relentless. Thankfully, the Allied forces defeated the global bullies of that era. Now, over 80 years later, we can consult history for potential answers to modern power struggles. As Russia’s military assault on Ukraine continues, the United States and NATO allies must respond together. After all, NATO, which is a collection of over 30 nations, was formed in 1949 after World War II to prevent what? Soviet aggression. NATO has a responsibility to step up. Those member countries have a respon-sibility to step in. All in all, hand in hand, the United States—which is also the first responder to anything that goes wrong in the world—needs to have help from other people, not America alone, but America with our allies. NATO’s purpose remains as important today as it was back then. A pow-erful, unified response has served the free world well throughout history. Now, much like World War II, we have existing or looming conflicts in multiple regions or theaters of the world including Asia. Today, China is threatening Taiwan. Now, as we are de-flected from watching what is going to happen in Taiwan and watching the dangerous situation in Taiwan by what is going on in Ukraine—and I don’t say we should take our eyes off of what is going on in Ukraine—we should just not think that that is the only theater that we have to be concerned with. Taiwan is one of our major allies, and in recent months multiple reports indi-cate that China has been quietly con-ducting combat readiness drills near Taiwan, an island territory that China still claims to own. This matters for two reasons: First, the Chinese are watching the world’s response to Putin’s attempt at a land grab in Ukraine because China is threatening to take over their own neighbor as well. Secondly, this could directly impact the American consumer. Ninety-two percent of the world’s supply of ad-vanced semiconductor chips—used in everything from automobiles to cellphones—are made in Taiwan. If we have learned nothing from the COVID pandemic, it is that we cannot depend on other people around the world to supply us with those things that we need the most. It is a fool’s er-rand to think that somehow this ends well. It does not. It ends terribly for us, and it ends terribly for the free world. Any large-scale attack on Taiwan means these chips would likely become very scarce as almost everything else in the world is right now, and in some cases probably unavailable altogether. That is why I am cosponsoring the Fa-cilitating American-Built Semiconduc-tors, or the FABS Act, with Congress-man MIKEMCCAUL. This piece of legislation allows for a new tax credit through 2032 for invest-ment in any semiconductor manufac-turing facility and semiconductor-de-signed expenditures right here at home. What an unusual concept: to invest in American technology with American workers to make America safer and stronger, not somebody a world away from us. Let’s do it right here at home. Let’s do it right here at home. Now, currently we make just 12 percent of the world’s semiconductor chip supply. That is hard for me to imagine that we knew at the time how nec-essary the semiconductor chips were, but we had kind of a blind eye and a deaf ear to what it was that manufac-turers were talking about. We said: Do you know what? For a couple of pen-nies we can save, let’s send them over to Taiwan and have them make it. And we walked away from what is so crit-ical to us. Now, the scary thing is that these are just the crises before us right now. His-tory reflects how a robust American foreign policy has significantly shaped the world, specifically the Western Hemisphere. So when we talk about the Western Hemisphere, this is one of the things I think that is probably going more unnoticed than anything: In the 1800s President Monroe knew that in its infancy the United States was de-veloping at a very quick rate, and it really looked like something that other places around the world would look at with envy and say: Do you know what? They are getting stronger every day, and they are getting better every day. Maybe we need to get over there and colonize. Maybe we need to get involved there. So the Monroe Doctrine came into effect, and the whole idea behind that was, let’s make sure that people around the world cannot make an ef-fort to come in and get into our West-ern Hemisphere and cause us great dan-ger. So the Monroe Doctrine came out. But then as things went on and we got more powerful and we had more and more going for us, all of a sudden, the world looked to us, and they just didn’t take a slight glance at us, but they looked at us with covetousness. They looked at us with who we were and what we were becoming and all the val-uable things that were right here in our hemisphere. b2015 So Teddy Roosevelt says: You know what? I am going to put together the Roosevelt Corollary that really estab-lishes guidelines for any intervention in the United States or our Western Hemisphere. The content within these policies largely addressed actions by European nations or the inactions of Latin Amer-ican nations. But I believe they are rel-evant, once again, and are worth fur-ther review, and here is why. If you were to take a look at the Western Hemisphere and just take a real broad look at it and say: Okay, fine, let’s take a close look. South America, Central America, up into the triangle, the deepwater ports in Cuba, and both ends of the Panama Canal all have significant foreign countries—and they are mainly China. People tell me: You don’t need to worry about that Panama Canal; China is not really taking it over. I say: You know what? If you don’t read history, you don’t study history, you are doomed to repeat it. Why would we not look at what is going on right now in our Western Hemisphere and say, we have put things into place to protect us from foreign intervention. I want to tell you, you look at the Western Hemisphere, South America, Central America, the triangle, the  deepwater ports in Cuba, that would be ideal for heavy military use, and both ends of the Panama Canal. If you don’t think that is a threat to American se-curity, then you need to wake up. We are in great danger right now and not knowing it. First of all, the Chinese are not very quiet about what they are trying to do. They have a theory that they want to take over the world. They don’t whis-per about it; they don’t sneak around about it; they just do what they want to do. Their presence in Africa should be a great awakening for us. We have crippled ourselves with regulations and sanctions on so many things that we need, and I don’t know for what reason, other than somehow we think that we are smarter than ev-erybody else and we know that we can protect ourselves. And the question is: Really, how? And the answer is: Well, we really can’t. I guess our answer will be what it always is: We will write a strong letter, and Jinping will get it. We will tell them: Please, stay out of our hemi-sphere and please stop trying to influ-ence the rest of the world for evil. And we will tell Putin: You need to stop doing what you are doing in Ukraine. At some point, we will actually read history and say we have been down this road before, but we failed to take ac-tion at a time that was absolutely crit-ical and pushed it on and pushed it out of sight, and the price we paid was in-credible. Let’s not do that again. There is an old saying that is: To be foretold is to be forewarned. With ev-erything going on in the world today, we hear a lot of people using the term ‘‘world war III.’’ I am not here tonight telling you that that is what is going to happen. I am here telling you to-night that America and the free world have to understand that we have seen this action before. We know what lies ahead of us, and we know the cost of not addressing it early. We can do it through policy, but peace always comes through strength, not through weakness. Diplomacy is one thing, as Teddy Roosevelt said: ‘‘Walk softly, but carry a big stick.’’ I would just suggest to you that if you go back to the year 2016—actually 2017, when our 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, came into office, please tell me why for the 4 years Mr. Trump was in office, the rest of the world stayed at bay? The bad ac-tors of the world didn’t attempt to do any of the things that they are doing today. Certainly, last summer, in our demonstration of how we would leave a country high and dry, that we would take out our military first and leave our military equipment and citizens to face what was going on in Afghanistan was a warning to the rest of the world that you better be careful with the United States, because if you are not, they will pack up their bags in the middle of the night and leave. That is not who we are, that is not who we have ever been, and that is not who we can be in a free world. If our friends and allies in the free world take a look at what our actions have been later—because actions al-ways speak louder than words—but we continue to use words, thinking that somehow bad actors will cower and walk away from us, that is not the America that we know. That is not the America that 1.4 million of our men and women in uniform have died to protect and to send a message to the bad actors of the world, we will always be here, we will always be on guard, and we will never walk away from our responsibilities. I don’t know what has happened to America in a little bit over a year. Peo-ple always say: I think it is better to be respected than feared. I think both have a great effect on everybody. I want both those to be in effect. I will tell you this: When Donald Trump was our President, nobody but nobody messed with the U.S.A. Mr. Speaker, we have so many things going on right now. We wonder: What is the future? What is the future not only for America but for America’s friends and allies? We look at energy as one of the key issues that we are talk-ing about today, and we know that in America we have endless supplies of energy. What is holding us back now are our own regulations. I heard the administration say: We have thousands of permits; why don’t you just go ahead and use them? Which really shows that they have absolutely no idea that having a permit isn’t the same as extracting energy. Somehow, I guess, if you say it long enough and loud enough and to the right crowd, they will nod their heads and say: I know. You are right. You know what? Get out into the field and see the people that actually do it. Talk to the people that know how to extract energy. Talk to the peo-ple that can go offshore. Talk to the people that go deep down into the Earth. Talk to all of those people and tell them: Don’t worry. You have a per-mit. Just go ahead and use it. And by the way, if you don’t use it, we will start taxing you on your nonuse. How upside down is this thinking? PRO-LIFE INFORMATION  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the last thing I am going to address tonight is probably the most important issue of all, because every-thing we talk about right now, every-thing we have addressed already, is about life. There was a tradition here that on Wednesdays people would wear red, and they would wear red to remind people of the girls that had been kidnapped by Boko Haram. We wanted those girls back, so we would wear red and would walk around here and say: We have got red on today because we want those girls back; Boko Haram has got to re-turn those girls. So I started wearing red on Wednesdays. Friends on the other side would say to me: So you are in concert with us; you believe the same things we do? I would say: I absolutely do. I abso-lutely do. They said: You want those girls back? I said: Yes, I do. But I don’t want just the girls that Boko Haram took; I want the girls back that have been aborted. I want those girls back whose lives were ended. I want you to really face the truth of what is going on in America today. The wordsmithing that takes place here in the people’s House, on the floor, people talk about abortion as healthcare, taking the life of a little boy or a little girl is healthcare. Every night, we see pictures of what Russia is doing to Ukraine. Yet, we have a deaf ear to the cries of the un-born, and we don’t look at all to those who are being lost every day. Because if you don’t see them, I guess they don’t count. Congress has long required that taxpayer dollars are not to be used for abortions, and President Biden has ac-tively tried to circumvent this require-ment. In April of 2021, under President Biden’s leadership, the NIH announced it would no longer require fetal tissue research projects funded by the agency to go through an ethics advisory board. So the question then becomes: Why do we have an ethics advisory board, if we are not going to go to them to find out what it is that we are talking about? Then in September of 2021, we began hearing the horrific allegations of ille-gal abortions being performed at the University of Pittsburgh for harvesting fetal tissue. I can tell you, me being on the floor tonight will resonate in Pittsburgh and, unfortunately, it won’t be by those who are pro-life; it will be by those that think that somehow this is an attack on Pitt and not an attack on little unborn boys and girls. For all of those who do not like what I am saying tonight, please take off your blinders and understand what is taking place. We began hearing all of these horrible allegations of illegal abortions being performed at the University of Pittsburgh for harvesting fetal tissue. These abortions were performed as part of Pitt’s participation in an NIH pro-gram for the university to operate as a fetal tissue repository for research hap-pening around the country. The types of abortions Pitt is accused of performing are horrific. Babies that survived the abortion would be born alive and then killed. This was to preserve—this is really hard to under-stand—this is to preserve the fetal cells longer, a process known as maximizing warm ischemia time. When you say: Well, what is that? When you talk to the scientists, well, the idea is the warm tissue is actually more valuable for our studies. So a baby boy or girl that survives this abortion, that is the tissue that is the most valuable to us. Now, I think if any of us came upon some kind of accident or saw somebody  who was in grave danger, we would want to save them. Somebody who has endured an unbelievable process and survived it, we would save them; we would not take advantage of that. This program was supported by taxpayer funding through the NIH pro-gram. So congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, for all the things that you hate, you are helping to fund it. This isn’t the only abortion project that the National Institutes of Health is funding, though. The NIH expects to spend $88 million on human fetal tissue research in this year alone. When these allegations began coming out—which I thought was a real good move by the university—they hired a law firm to conduct an independent re-view of Pitt’s abortion process. Some-body is questioning the process you do, so you say: Here is what I will do. I want to participate with you, so I will provide the funding to an independent research group. That law firm was a Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm that employs Pitt grads. What a sur-prise. The review determined that Pitt was totally in compliance with the law. They didn’t say what Pitt was doing was right; they said they were in com-pliance with the law, even though that report completely failed to look into Planned Parenthood or UPMC, who were partners with this NIH program. When all of this came out, we sent a letter, along with Representative MORGAN GRIFFITH and over 50 of our colleagues, asking the NIH for answers on how it funds and oversees these abor-tions programs. It took them months to respond to me, which is not unusual for any letter you send to any agency here in Washington, D.C. When they finally did reply to us, they simply pointed out to me and to the rest of us: Please, look at Pitt’s independent review. Now, this level of accountability to Congress is completely unacceptable, and it shouldn’t take months for a gov-ernment agency to respond to letters from any of us here in the House of Representatives. We are here rep-resenting the people who voted us in office. And when they do respond, they should respond with a substantive an-swer. I don’t need to be horsed around and told something and told: Well, you just don’t understand. Which is absolutely correct. I don’t understand. In the United States of America, why are we doing things and then covering them up and saying, we did an independent review. We paid for it, and these guys actually came up with an answer that we were looking for. So they followed the money. A few weeks ago, Congress finally passed a budget, the first since Presi-dent Biden has been in office. It was far from perfect, but it included strong protections for the unborn, protections which have been in place since the 1970s. Less than 2 weeks later, President Biden released his 2023 budget proposal, which included a full wish list of Democrat anti-life priorities. Here are some examples from his recent budget: Number 1, it eliminates the Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. It be-came law in 1976. The Hyde amendment has saved over 2.4 million lives. b2030 It also wants to eliminate the Dornan amendment. The Dornan amend-ment prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to pay for abortion in the District of Columbia. Without this pro-tection, D.C. taxpayer dollars could pay for an estimated 1,400 to 1,500 abor-tions every year. Every year. It increased Title X family planning funding by $113 million. Title X is a prime funding source for Planned Par-enthood, providing it with $56 million taxpayer dollars annually. Now, on January 21, 2022, the Biden administra-tion awarded $6.6 million in Title X funds from the American Rescue Plan to abortion providers. $6.6 million in American taxpayer money to provide funds for abortion providers. Now, I am Catholic, and oftentimes I have gone to my priest and I have said, ‘‘Father, is there some reason you can-not go into the pulpit and talk about the horrendous things that are going on in our country today?’’ You know what the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said? ‘‘The USCCB re-mains gravely concerned about the continued efforts to expand taxpayer funding of abortion, which would occur if the Hyde amendment or any other lifesaving appropriations riders were to be removed from the annual appropria-tions bill.’’ \n",

      "Mrs. BOEBERT ) for 30 minutes. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, this past Friday, Biden’s CDC, formally known as the Centers for Disease Con-trol, but often referred to now as the center for Democrat control, an-nounced that it would be ending title 42. At a time when liberal mayors across our country are extending mask man-dates on our children in schools, and the American public is still being forced to mask-up on airplanes, the Biden regime has decided that pro-tecting the American people from dis-eases, including but not limited to COVID, is not a priority if it comes at the expense of their amnesty and open borders agenda. Now, it is no coincidence that the Biden regime has decided to drop title 42, a policy that has been used to pre-vent communicable diseases from spreading into the homeland via illegal aliens entering our southern border. In fact, more than 2 million illegal aliens have been apprehended at our southern border since Joe Biden took office, and Border Patrol agents esti-mate another 70 percent of these illegal immigrants have not been appre-hended. They call them got-aways. So, in fact, that means nearly 3.5 million illegal aliens have come across our bor-der on Biden’s watch. Now, Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate have condemned canceling title 42. Some have called it dangerous, and others have called it frightening. I call it an attack on the safety and security of the American people. It has been reported that by the time the mid-terms roll around in November of 2022, nearly 7 million illegal aliens will have crossed the southern border this year. That is larger than the popu-lations of Denver, San Francisco, At-lanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Se-attle, Miami, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Portland, Tampa, and Detroit com-bined. Can you imagine? We have a product here that is working. We have a policy that is working to deter some people away from the border, but we are going to take what-ever sliver we have that is keeping peo-ple out of our country illegally and do away with it. Maybe it is to overrun our system, maybe it is to create chaos; 8 to 10 years of backlogs, so then the Amer-ican people have to accept amnesty. I am not sure exactly what the plan is, but it certainly is intentional, and that is what members of the House Freedom Caucus are here to discuss tonight. I have with me members from the House Freedom Caucus who are going to address what has been going on at the southern border. We have been to the southern border multiple times to see firsthand what is happening—the invasion that is taking place in our country—unlike the border czar, who has failed to visit the most dangerous parts of our southern border. I think she made a trip to El Paso. And then, of course, the Commander in Chief, who is in command of nothing, he hasn’t been there at all.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the former chairman of the House Freedom Cau-cus, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS), my good friend. Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. I would like to help set the stage here just for a moment. Imagine, if you will, 100,000 people entering the country ille-gally and stopped on our border just in the first 2 weeks of March of this year. But because of title 42, which allows the Border Patrol agents to imme-diately turn people away because of communicable diseases, that is the term used in title 42, they sent 50,000 of them back away. You don’t have to imagine it because that is true. That is exactly what happened. If you extrapolate that out, because you can, just looking at it from Janu-ary, February, March of this year, they turned away over a quarter million people under title 42. Now, when title 42 goes away on May 23, because that is exactly what this administration wants, you will double the amount of people who are coming in just through the apprehension route. We have another record month in March. Those numbers are just out. That means that you are going to be sitting on about 300,000 to 400,000 appre-hensions that you are going to be re-leasing right into the United States of America. What does that do? Everybody in here knows this because you have been down to the border. I have been down to the border with you. The cartels are in it to make money. As they see this opening up, more and more people get-ting freedom to the United States caught and released, what they will do, and what they are already doing, by the way, is they will advertise. The NGOs that we help fund, that the United Nations funds, will advertise. It will be chaos, chaos on the border. My prediction is somewhere around 400,000 to 500,000 people a month coming in. But it actually could be more. A lot of people are talking about the ceiling now being 18,000 people a day when that goes away. I don’t think it is going to be 18,000. I think it will exceed 20,000. If it exceeds 20,000, that is 600,000 a month coming in. That is bigger than the city of Mesa in Arizona, which is Arizona’s second largest city. You know what that means? In the last half of this year, the last half of the year alone, you are going to be sit-ting, as you said, at 41⁄2to 5 million people brought into this country ille-gally, and that is not counting the get- aways. The get-aways last year were at least 800,000. It is enormous; it is dangerous; it is inhumane. I haven’t even touched on the inhumanity of it. We are just talk-ing up here. We are not getting granu-lar. We are just talking about the over-running of America, our culture, and our sovereignty. We won’t have much of a nation after this is done. You said it yourself, is this incompetence? The answer is no, this is will-ful. This is willful, and this is what they want. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. BIGGS, do you believe that the cartels have been emboldened during Biden’s first year as President of the United States? Mr. BIGGS. Absolutely, 100 percent. Do you know how we know they have been emboldened? Because it used to be they would have the coyotes take the people up and locate them in the U.S. They don’t do that anymore. The coyotes take them up, they put them on the border and say, ‘‘We don’t have to go in with you. Go in. Go in with your cell phone.’’ Oh, by the way, Biden administration says now they are going to give away a cell phone to every illegal alien crossing the border. But they will just come across. I have seen it; you have all seen it. They are walking across, they are FaceTiming their friends back home: ‘‘Yeah, I made it in.’’ They are dressed nice; they are dressed clean. The car-tels are emboldened not just at the southern border any longer. This is spilling over into the country, and we are seeing violence along the border because of it, and you are seeing cartel members ship all over. If there are drugs being distributed anywhere in the United States, you have got car-tels there. Mrs. BOEBERT. What about these illegal aliens who are coming through with the help of the cartel, what do they owe the cartel for getting into the United States? Mr. BIGGS. The average price right now is $4,000 to $7,000, unless you are from China, and then it is $35,000. Very few of these people have that to pay. Guess what happens? Either they can work it off by delivering illicit drugs, helping to smuggle human beings, in-cluding sex trafficking, or they come in, they get a job, and they are inden-tured servants. They are effectively slaves to the cartel, and they will never work it off, because the cartels are taskmasters at this. They know ex-actly how to keep these folks under their thumb. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. BIGGS, you also chair the Border Security Caucus, and you recently brought in Secretary Mayorkas. Thank you for bringing him here to the Hill so we could ask some questions. Now, he was talking about title 42 being a CDC issue, and that is not real-ly his issue to enforce. That is not his policy to enforce. What is a policy that he could enforce that would effectively secure our border? Mr. BIGGS. He could enforce the MPP, the migrant protection protocols. That is the remain in Mexico pol-icy. What he could do is, instead of en-forcing that at 9 people a day—that is the number we heard earlier this week, 9 people a day—you could actually en-force it the way it was intended to be enforced, and that would be thousands a day because we have thousands of folks coming in. That would be another deterrent. That is just one of the things that he could do. He could actually go in and encourage us to fix the Flores law or the TVPRA laws. All of those things would be deterrents. But, instead, he has opened it wide open. He has taken away any deterrent. Instead, he is basi-cally encouraging people to come into this country illegally. Mrs. BOEBERT. Thank you. Now, one final question for you here. You are a businessman. We may have 7 mil-lion undocumented workers in our country by November. What does that mean for our economy? Mr. BIGGS. Well, first of all, the underground economy right now for peo-ple, my estimate is about 25 to 27 mil-lion illegal aliens in the country. You are going to bring in another 7 million, so you are going to have an under-ground economy. Those people who are not skilled laborers are going to have a tough time getting jobs. A lot of these folks are going to go on social welfare programs, even though they are not supposed to be allowed to. They will get on social welfare programs. We are already on the verge of stagflation right now, high inflation and a shrinking GDP. As that happens, and you bring in that many people undocu-mented, you are going to actually ex-acerbate both those problems, and we may see the likes of something we haven’t seen since Jimmy Carter. It might even exceed what happened under Jimmy Carter, who was probably the most unfortunate and incompetent President in my lifetime. Mrs. BOEBERT. We have more Members joining us here from the House Freedom Caucus to talk about title 42. Thank you so much, Congressman BIGGS, for your insight on this. I know that you work really hard in studying what is going on at the southern bor-der. I have the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN ) here now. Do you believe that this regime is respon-sible for signaling to poor and des-perate people that now is the time to take this dangerous journey, to break our laws, to come into our country, and live under the freedoms and protec-tions our country provides but not as a citizen? Mr. NORMAN. Well, first of all, thank you for organizing this discus-sion to inform the American people what is going on. As Andy has said, this President is willfully and directly causing this to happen to the American people. You are a businessperson. You run a restaurant. I am in the development world. Who would let anybody come into your business or to your home, not know who they were, not know why they were there? It is insane what this administration is doing. By taking title 42, as has been said, it prohibits—that is the only tool that President Trump had at his dis-posal and President Biden has, but he is doing away with it because that is what he is encouraging. Lauren, think about this, how unfair is it to that law enforcement agency,  that law enforcement official stopping a car not knowing who is in it, not knowing what his background is, hav-ing no information, how safe is that for that law enforcement officer? b2045 Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, how unfair is it to the municipalities and the cities that are going to have to pay for the hospital care, for the schooling? How fair is that? Well, it is not. It is intentional. It is willful. As people ask me all the time, why is he doing this? He is burning the house down before, I assume, the November elections, which the House will turn over, and hopefully, we will elect Free-dom Caucus members who have got the steel and the spine to do something about it. He sold out not only to the citizens; he sold out to China and those that he is indebted to. We are going to find out more and more about that as we move forward. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am so happy that the gentlewoman from Col-orado organized this effort tonight. We need to be speaking about it, and of course, I would call on our friends from this side of the aisle. It is interesting that we are standing on this side of the aisle. I mean, thank goodness somebody is willing to stand over here and defend the country. Mr. Speaker, I call on my Democrat colleagues to start answering some questions and start defending their country from this invasion. But if the gentleman doesn’t know this, if you do a quick calculation—this isn’t Congressman PERRY , Congresswoman B OEBERT , Congressman R OY, any of us up here. This is DHS. The De-partment of Homeland Security is bracing for 18,000 crossings a day, 18,000 people coming across the border ille-gally each day. Now, I don’t know, for each one of you, the size of your town where you come from, but I suspect 18,000 in any town would make a pretty big dent un-less you are talking about one of the major cities like Los Angeles or some-thing like that. Even so, 18,000 a day, Mr. Speaker, that is over 61⁄2million people, if we keep that rate up, 61⁄2million people in 1 year illegally coming to our country. Congressman N ORMAN or Congresswoman B OEBERT , could your business sustain something like that? Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. The city of Rifle just hit 10,000 for our population. I mean, 18,000 people a day, that right there exceeds the little city of Rifle, Colorado. But this is something that we absolutely cannot endure, so I am glad that we have this time tonight to discuss this. Representative GOOD, you have been to the southern border. You have talked to Border Patrol agents. Can you tell me what you have seen, what you have heard from Border Patrol agents? Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I have been there four times in my first year, the first 14 months here in this Congress. February a year ago was the largest February in terms of illegal border crossings in the history of the country. We had 101,000 cross, some 3,000 a day, in February a year ago. We exceeded that by 64 percent this most recent February. We went from 101,000 to 165,000. Now, it is so bad with what this President has allowed to happen in the last year that 165,000 in a month doesn’t sound like a really bad month for this President. That is because, again, it was 101,000 last February, but it increased as the year went on to where it was some 200,000 a month later on into the year, as we know, and 2 million in the first year this President was in office. As others have already pointed out, with him rescinding title 42, I guess he was afraid that is a policy, a law, that might help repel some illegals back across the border, might allow us to re-turn some if we actually would enforce the law. So, we are rescinding title 42, which, as already has been said, will take it from 7,000 to 21⁄2times as large. Mr. Speaker, 18,000 a day is the average, 500,000 in the first 30 days. This President is on pace for some 10 to 15 million illegal entries into our country in his first and hopefully only term. I was in a Budget Committee hearing today with Congresswoman BOEBERT . We had Secretary Becerra there, the HHS Secretary. HHS has been called in not to help stop the border crossings but to help facilitate those. Mr. Speaker, I asked him today, I said: Who do you think should be let across our border, or who should be prevented from going across our bor-der? Are there any restraints you would put upon anyone who wants to come across our border, or do you think everyone should be able to come across illegally? He said: Well, we are talking about violating the law. You are saying it is illegal. Why would we permit anyone to violate the law? Our President is violating the highest law of the land. The Constitution that we all and he swore to uphold, Ar-ticle IV, Section 4 says: ‘‘The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of gov-ernment and shall protect them against invasion.’’ As we look to next year, I want to go on record and say—some of you were on the articles of impeachment with me. Congresswoman BOEBERT drafted those. How do we declare this the pub-lic health emergency that it is, the na-tional security crisis that it is, the health crisis that it is, the social serv-ices crisis that it is, the education cri-sis that it is, and the unlawful process that it is and not hold this President responsible when we have the House majority, Lord willing, a year from now? How can we not impeach this President? Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I agree that that absolutely needs to be brought up in the next Congress. Now, these appointed Secretaries, they really have turned our Border Pa-trol agents into travel agents. They are being shipped all throughout our coun-try, these illegal immigrants, and every State is now a border State. Congressman GOODis from Virginia. We have Congressman R ALPH NORMAN  here from South Carolina. I am from Colorado. But someone who has a front seat view here, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), this has been a really hot topic for him, and rightfully so. Republicans and Democrats from both Houses of Congress have said that they don’t support ending title 42, yet no legislation or action has been taken to reinstate it. What are your thoughts on that? Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT ), and I thank all colleagues from the House Freedom Caucus for joining me here on the floor. I thank my friend from Virginia, who joined me down in Del Rio, Texas, just a month ago, where we saw firsthand what is actually happening in real-time on the border, something that we know and, unfortunately, my colleagues on this side of the aisle refuse to acknowl-edge and refuse to do anything about. Now, as you all know, one of our Freedom Caucus colleagues from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL ) filed, 14 months ago, a piece of legislation to require that title 42 be enforced at our border. For those listening at home, title 42 is our power as a country to stop communicable diseases and people with communicable diseases from coming across our border. It is an important tool that President Trump and his ad-ministration put in place in the last year of his administration to ensure that we stop the flow of people across the border from inundating and over-whelming Border Patrol. We knew this was coming. Fourteen months ago, we knew this was coming. A year ago, we came together. I filed a discharge petition as part of this team to say that we can force a vote on the floor of the House. Well, the Speaker of the House refuses to bring to a vote a measure to enforce title 42. Everybody listening at home, the Speaker of the House, who has control of the floor, refuses to bring forward a vote on title 42 to re-quire enforcement of the border. We are trying to change that. We have almost every single Republican, I think save one, who has filed that, 210 signatures. We need 218. Where are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle? Where are those from border States? Mr. Speaker, we have zero Democrats on that title 42 discharge position.  Now, as the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. B OEBERT ) noted, there are at least four noteworthy United States Senators who are Democrats who said we should not end title 42: Mr. TESTER , Mr. M ANCHIN , Ms. S INEMA , and Mr. KELLY . Those four Senators have said we should not end title 42. Now, I will wrap up and pass it to someone else just to say this: How many dead migrants is enough? How many dead Americans from fentanyl poisoning is enough? How much money in the pockets of dangerous cartels is enough? How many bullets need to fly at the border? How many homes need to be destroyed? How many cars need to be wrecked? How many DPS agents need to be killed or endangered? How many people need to be harmed before this adminis-tration will do its job? How many criminals need to be let off in the United States and not prosecuted under ICE? When are we going to change this and actually secure our country? Those are my questions for Secretary Mayorkas. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, we talk about this issue regularly in our meetings with the House Freedom Caucus, and one question that comes up regu-larly is, where is KAMALA HARRIS ? Where is the border czar in this? Are there any plans for her to visit the southern border? Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin. Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, KAMALA  who? In all seriousness, it is unfortu-nate that Vice President HARRIS has not fulfilled her mission to be the bor-der czar. It is awful. Did you see the news today in regard to the free phones that the White House Press Secretary talked about today, free phones for migrants? Think about it. I was down in Panama almost a year ago and went to the Darien Gap. Who did I see? IOM, the International Organization for Migra-tion. Where do they get their money? They get a lot of their money from the United Nations. Who puts the most money into the United Nations? Yes, Americans do. Back home on the farm, we used to refer to this as—my colleague from Texas just said how many, how many? I would say to you also: How much? We used to refer to it as eating your seed corn. Americans pay an inter-national organization to send debit cards for these people to take them-selves up the Panama pipeline all the way to the southern border. Then you pay for a bus ride to get them to the airport. Then you pay for an airline ride: Philadelphia, Baltimore, wher-ever. They are going around the coun-try. Then you pay for the education, the free education they are going to get. You pay for the healthcare. That is what you Americans are paying for every single day for over 2 mil-lion people, and it is about to get worse. To highlight how it is going to get worse and how obtuse this side of the aisle is, we are sitting in the Com-mittee on the Judiciary today creating another loophole in the Virgin Islands. There is another loophole that is being created for visa waiver privileges, something that we saw in the Mariana Islands that was created about a dec-ade ago under the Obama administra-tion where they allowed parole for peo-ple to be able to come in, Chinese na-tionals. There were maybe, like, eight births that were being done on those islands prior to this change that was quietly made in the law. It accelerated to— there were, like, 600 births of Chinese nationals that happened in the Mar-iana Islands as a result of this loop-hole. If you want to see the reporting on it, The Wall Street Journal did an excel-lent job. It was one of our intelligence agencies in 2017 that really dug into this. Yes, here is this huge loophole, and they want to now create it in the Vir-gin Islands. That is what we are voting on tonight in the Committee on the Ju-diciary. They want to create another loophole, and they are, like, oh, it will only be a few people. Do the American peo-ple believe that? Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my fellow border Stater being down here. You hold those Mounties back up there, okay? Keep them at bay. Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, every State is a border State, including my State of Wisconsin. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is not just the phones. What about the gas cards that are in the latest budget that the President had? What about that? Just to put some context to this, Texas, I think you have about 15 to 20 million people. South Carolina has 5.3 million. That is the number that is going to be coming into this country in the next 4 months if the pace con-tinues. It is a travesty. It is something that Americans have to be aware of and stop. God help us all if they do exactly what was said. To fund all of this, America is at the breaking point. Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, so if I may extend my point a little bit. Think about it. Tonight, we are debat-ing, in the Judiciary Committee, cre-ating another loophole. It shows how unserious they are, how they do not have the interests of the American peo-ple at hand. They want to create an-other loophole, and this one is in the Virgin Islands, not in the South Pa-cific. People are going to be able to be funneled in here by the thousands as a re-sult of that loophole—just another way to bring people into this country to compete against hardworking Ameri-cans who have to not only try to make their way up the scale, the economic ladder here in America, but now, with inflation, they have to fight that, too. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, we are wrapping up here. We have 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman for his final thoughts. Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, my final thoughts are that there are Democrats that are decrying this. We can do some-thing about it, and they can do some-thing about it right here in this House. They can walk right down there to the well and sign this discharge petition. We don’t need all of them; we need eight of them. Bring the bill up. If they don’t believe we ought to continue to try and secure our border with title 42, they can vote against it, but let us have a vote. We are just asking for a vote. Let’s see what the vote count is, and then the American people will know who stands with them and who stands for a wide-open border because that is what we are going to have. Think about that. To the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT ), we certainly appreciate her putting this together for us and providing the opportunity to come and talk on behalf of our constituents that are very concerned about this. Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, the chairman could lead the way. He could lead the way. Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would only add that I have seen some reports that there are a number of Democrats in the Senate joining with Republicans in the Senate to try to do something about this. I hope that is true. But my little warning to that is, I keep hearing words about, well, let’s keep title 42 in place until we see a plan. Look, I don’t want one of these plans full of words, okay? I want the border secure. I want title 42 enforced. That ought to be the metric that we are gauging everything by. b2100 Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is simple. Complete the wall. End catch and release. Reinstate remain in Mexico and title 42. Require E-verify. Take amnesty off the table. Speaker Mrvan, we would love to have you on that petition. Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, sign the petition. Folks, have the courage to call your Congressman. And, folks, it is time, as Winston Churchill said: ‘‘Sometimes doing your best is not good enough.’’ We have to do what is required to close this border. Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from the House Freedom Caucus for joining me here on the House floor tonight to discuss this issue. I would encourage all Members of Congress—both bodies, the House and Senate—to talk to a Border Patrol agent. Ask them about the policies that they need to secure our southern border. I guarantee you, they won’t be telling you they need funding or per-sonnel or even infrastructure. They  just need the policy to do their jobs so they can go home feeling like they have accomplished something and have protected American citizens. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. \n",

      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened to the Republican leader speak-ing about the Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is coming before the Senate either today or tomorrow, we hope, for a confirma-tion vote. We have solid support for her nomination on the Democratic side and three Republican Senators who have announced that they will join us to make it a bipartisan majority in her favor. She is deserving of this. She has an extraordinary background. She has the kind of resume that every lawyer would dream of: to graduate from Har-vard Law School and then to clerk at every level of the Federal judiciary, in-cluding clerk to the Justice she hopes to succeed, Stephen Breyer; and then to serve on the Sentencing Commis-sion, which is considered one of the more prestigious assignments, trying to rationalize the sentencing under Federal law; and then, of course, to serve on the district court in the DC district and to issue some 570 or 80 dif-ferent opinions—written opinions—dur-ing that time; to be elevated to the DC Circuit Court, often called the second highest court in the land, where she served as well with distinction; and now to be the first African-American woman nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is an incredible record. And she has made the rounds, as they say, in the Senate, visiting 95 or 96 dif-ferent Senators, sitting down with them privately in their offices, answer-ing any questions or concerns that they wish to express. So I think she is an exceptional person. If you look at her record in all of these cases that she has handed down written opinions in—as I said, it is close to 600, and 100 of them were criminal cases where she imposed sen-tences, and some 10 or 15 of those cases which have been highlighted by her Re-publican critics, relating to the issue of the exploitation of children and por-nography, in every single case, she im-posed a prison sentence. So to argue that she is soft on crime is to ignore that reality and to ignore the reality that she is endorsed—en-dorsed—by the largest law enforcement organization in America, the Fraternal Order of Police. She is endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and other noteworthy organiza-tions, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement, former pros-ecutors in the District of Columbia. She has made it very clear that when it comes to applying the law to the facts, she does it with evenhandedness, so much so that she is respected by both sides of the table—the prosecu-tor’s side of the table and the defense side of the table. That takes some doing, but she has achieved it. And  that is why her selection by President Biden is the right person for the right time for the right job. She is going to make history if we give her this con-firming vote. Now, I will tell you, when you publish some 580 to 600 opinions, you are going to find something in one of those opinions to raise. I listened carefully as Senator MCCONNELL went to one of those opinions and drew his own con-clusions. I would ask him to take care in accepting that as the fair way to measure a person. People often say that in the U.S. Senate—they ask us: Are you conservative or are you liberal or are you a fiscal conservative? Where do you stand on civil liberties? And people announce a position that they would like to believe they fit in. Then folks go back and look at your voting record and then ask: Well, how do you explain this, Senator? So in any given day, any given vote can raise a ques-tion as to a generalization about who you are and what you believe. For instance, there was a time, as hard as it may be to believe, when peo-ple were suggesting amending the Con-stitution of the United States to make burning an American flag a violation— controversial. All of us revere the flag, but the notion of making this an amendment to the Constitution was a matter of great controversy and de-bate. I remember it well in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I came down against it, saying that I revered the flag, but the principles and values be-hind it were equally or more important to me, and so I opposed flag burning and so did the Senator from Kentucky. Yes, the minority leader, Senator MCCONNELL , opposed flag burning. The organization that agreed with our posi-tion was the ACLU. Now, can I gener-alize from that position which Senator MCCONNELL took years ago that he is an ACLU-type of Senator? It would be wrong to draw that conclusion. There may have been other instances where he agreed with them, but it was rare. What I am saying is, if you can take one vote and measure a Senator and re-alize that it falls short of being an ac-curate and honest measurement, the same thing is true for a judge, to take one opinion and say: Well, she ruled against President Trump on the issue of immigration, therefore, she is an ac-tivist liberal judge. She ruled as well for President Trump in other cases in his favor, and ruled against Democratic Presidents when they came up with their proposals before the court. So generalizations are not fair for her or for individual Members of the Senate based on one opinion, one vote, and that is what many are trying to do. I will also tell you that this notion— and it pains me to even bring it to the floor, but I know it is going to come up in the next day or two—that she is soft on crime. As I mentioned, the law en-forcement groups would not be endors-ing her if they believed she was soft on crime. And the notion that she is somehow, in the words of one Republican Sen-ator—that her sentencing ‘‘endangers children,’’ that is painful because he said as much in front of her family. And I thought about that, how painful that must have been for her to hear those words. They are not true. And to take one or two situations, each of them unique in their factual cir-cumstances, and to generalize in terms of her position on an issue of that grav-ity is fundamentally unfair. But we have done it, too, on the Democratic side, and I am going to be the first to admit, as I look back in history, there are things that should have been han-dled better when Republican nominees were before us. And the majority of Republican Senators on the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee, led by Ranking Member CHUCK  GRASSLEY , I believe, were respectful and dealt with the judge in a fair man-ner. They asked tough questions, as they were expected to, but did not cross the line into personal attack. There were three or four who broke that rule, as far as I was concerned, but the vast majority of Republican Sen-ators were factual, were fair, and were basing their questions on sound legal questions before any Supreme Court nominee’s consideration. That I think will be talked about over the next cou-ple days, as it should be. TRIBUTE TO ERIK RAVEN  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank a former member of my staff who is an extraordinary man. He is smart, he gives wise counsel, and is truly devoted to this Nation. He worked for me for years. I have worked with Erik Raven since 2014, when I became ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Sub-committee on Defense, and Erik was the chief clerk of the subcommittee. The title ‘‘clerk’’ is misleading. He was the brains and the operational force be-hind that subcommittee. As my right hand, Erik led the massive and critically important effort to appropriate an average of $700 billion a year for our national defense budget. Incidentally, that is about half of our Government’s annual discretionary spending—a big assignment—and Erik was the right person for that assign-ment. As I mentioned before, my first introduction to the Senate was many years ago, as an intern to a former Illinois Senator, Paul Douglas. Douglas was a respected economist who joined the Marines at age 50—50—to defend de-mocracy in World War II. He was badly wounded, became a war hero, and then was elected to the Senate. Douglas famously said that you don’t have to be a wastrel to be a liberal. Douglas fought against waste in gov-ernment because he understood that every misspent dollar weakens our na-tional defense, every wasted dollar un-dermines our ability to build a better future. I think Paul Douglas would have liked Erik Raven. Erik has been a stalwart ally in my efforts to advance our national defense capabilities while also protecting tax-payers’ dollars and investing in things like defense medical research and do-mestic sourcing of the components critical to our defense industrial base. I traveled with Erik to more places than I can remember. There was one particularly eye-opening visit to a classified facility in a desert outside Las Vegas. You might say it was out of this world. I will also remember a trip we made to Poland and the Baltics in 2018, wherein we discussed the danger of the overreliance on Russian gas and other issues. Today, we see that play-ing out, tragically, in Ukraine. It was also a relief to have Erik at my side. His deep institutional knowl-edge, his sense of humor, and his black bag full of secrets have served me and the committee and America well. I know that Senator JONTESTER of Montana, the new chair of that same subcommittee, and other Senators with whom Erik worked share my high re-gard for him. In his 20 years in the Senate, Erik has worked for Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN , the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Robert Byrd, Senator Inouye, our former colleague Senator Mikulski, and our current chairman, Senator LEAHY . To countless Senate staffers along the way, Erik has been a mentor, a cheerleader, and always a friend. In addition to his public service, he is a pilot and a black belt in karate. He enjoys golfing and running. He is a de-voted husband to Ann, his wife, and fa-ther to Edward, his 7-year-old son. Very soon, pending Senate approval, he will be our Nation’s next Under Sec-retary of the Navy. The Senate’s loss is the Navy’s and America’s gain. I am confident that Erik will excel in his new challenge just as he has in the Senate. I wish him the very best of luck and thank him for his outstanding service. FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES  Mr. President, it has been almost 6 years since the disastrous collapse of the infamous for-profit college chain ITT Tech. At that time, ITT Tech was one of the largest chains of for-profit colleges in the country—130 campuses spread over 38 States and 40,000 students en-rolled. It closed its campuses 2 weeks after the Federal Department of Edu-cation barred the parent company from enrolling any more students while using Federal student aid dollars. I have come to this floor countless times to talk about the deceptive, predatory, desperate tactics of the for- profit college industry at large. At the peak of its profitability, in 2000 to 2003, it was the hottest sector on Wall Street. Publicly traded shares in for-profit colleges rose 460 percent according to one analysis. In 2010, these for-profit colleges swept up more than $32 billion in Federal student aid dollars. Hundreds of millions more flowed in through the GI bill. For ITT  Tech, the total haul in Federal dollars that year reached $1.1 billion. Six years later, the whole ITT Tech house of cards collapsed in a cloud of scandal, leaving students and taxpayers holding the bag. Now a new report by the Project on Predatory Student Lending reveals dis-turbing facts about ITT Tech—their de-ception, their high-pressure recruiting tactics, and other forms of fraud and abuse that they used to rack up mas-sive profits. The report is entitled ‘‘Dreams Destroyed: How ITT Tech-nical Institute Defrauded a Generation of Students.’’ What makes this new report particularly damning is that the details of these abuses came not only from de-frauded students but from the com-pany’s own recruiters and top execu-tives. Like the internal company memos that finally shed light on the inner workings of the tobacco industry, the ITT records reveal a company that prioritized profits over everything else. Two years before ITT Tech’s collapse, the company’s disgraced CEO, Kevin Modany, wrote in an email to his mar-keting chief: I do not have anything more important on my agenda . . . [recruitment] is my personal top priority. Prospective students were lied to and bombarded with high-pressure tactics to get them to enroll and sign up for more and more and more student loans. One former ITT Tech recruiter compared the working conditions to a ‘‘sweatshop,’’ where all that mattered was hitting a ‘‘quota.’’ Appallingly, recruiters were instructed to use the ‘‘pain funnel,’’ they called it, which was a set of eight ques-tions designed to reveal all prospective students’ vulnerabilities. By identi-fying a student’s pain points, such as working at a dead-end job or feeling unappreciated, recruiters were trained to exploit that pain and present ITT Tech as the solution to this poor stu-dent’s problems. ITT Tech then inflated grades and falsified attendance records to keep students enrolled so they could squeeze out more Federal dollars and leave more student debt for the kids. The company routinely, falsely, filed finan-cial aid forms, including stealing stu-dents’ passwords and signing financial aid forms without the students’ knowl-edge or consent. The list goes on and on. The result: Modany and the ITT shareholders made millions. Taxpayers got ripped off. Students ended up hold-ing the bag with worthless diplomas, if they finished, and with a mountain of student debt whether they finished or not. What did Modany think about the students he was defrauding? Look at his words. This is the man who was the executive who was doing this to these students. He said: ‘‘Take off the gloves with the student and slug back. Do not hold back in any way, and anything that we can put out there to question the legitimacy of his complaint we should most definitely do so. We need to call him out publicly.’’ That is the kind of respect they had for these students. Many of these students, as the majority leader knows, were first-generation college students. Their mothers and fa-thers were so proud that they were at ITT Tech—that they made it into col-lege. Mom and dad thought they would have to work extra hours, but it would be worth it. It was a fraud from start to finish—a fraud on American tax-payers and a terrible fraud on these students and their families. Modany was equally contemptuous of public officials who asked questions about ITT Tech’s business practices. This 2015 email is a racist tirade against an Education Department offi-cial, Rohit Chopra, a longtime foe of predatory lenders who is now Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Modany rails that Mr. Chopra ought to be jailed at Guantanamo and waterboarded. Now, you might say, ‘‘That’s great, but ITT Tech is gone. Why does it mat-ter?’’ First: There are still tens of thousands of ITT Tech students who were defrauded. Under the Higher Education Act’s Borrower Defense provision, their loans should be discharged by the Edu-cation Department. The evidence revealed in this report—evidence collected by the Edu-cation Department and numerous State attorneys general—clearly shows that fraud was rampant and systemic at ITT Tech. The Department should do more to provide ITT Tech borrowers with the relief to which they are entitled under the law—without requiring individual applications. The second reason is stated in the report’s conclusion, which asserts ‘‘ITT was able to escape responsibility for its financial insolvency by declaring bank-ruptcy in September 2016. Its execu-tives simply walked away from the dis-aster they created.’’ Kevin Modany was fined $200,000. But that is essentially a parking ticket for a man who made $36 million defrauding students, taxpayers, and investors be-tween 2007 and 2014. The Federal Government must use its authority to hold for-profit college executives personally accountable. Claw back some of their fat profits to repay students and taxpayers. And third, the for-profit college industry continues to prey on students using the same tactics as the band of thieves at ITT Tech. For-profit Ashford University and its former parent company Zovio were just found to have given students false or misleading information about career outcomes . . . cost and financial aid . . . and transfer credits . . . to get them to enroll. Sound familiar? Ashford was ordered to pay more than $22.37 million in penalties. But . . . Zovio recently sold Ashford to the University of Arizona while con-tinuing to operate much of the school. What actions will the Education Department take to protect students . . . and taxpayer dollars . . . at the now- renamed Arizona Global Campus—for-merly Ashford? I’ve spoken about these matters with both Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Rich Cordray, head of the Department’s Federal Student Aid of-fice. I’m glad the Biden administration has committed publicly to improving enforcement at the Department of Edu-cation. There are other ITT Techs out there. For the sake of students and taxpayers, the Education Department under this administration must begin to use its immense enforcement authority to pro-tect them from the swindlers and conmen. Mr. President, I have been talking about for-profit colleges for a number of years. Luckily, we have a President and a Secretary of Education who are putting watchmen in place, guardians of students in place, who believe that it is more important that kids are treat-ed fairly and honestly than it is for some executive to make millions of dollars off of an abuse of the system. I yield the floor. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, not only for his wonderful remarks here today but for his passion on this issue. He was one of the first to blow the whistle on these colleges. When you hear about this, it just boils your blood—boils your blood. These kids did nothing wrong. It is one of the reasons we believe student debt should be forgiven. The Federal Gov-ernment gave them the loans—that was required by law—but they were taken advantage of through no fault of their own. I wonder if this Mr. Modany has been prosecuted for any of these things. He does not deserve to have, probably, the millions he has on the backs of all of these students. But I thank the Senator from the bottom of my heart. This boils our blood, what they did to these kids. That is one of the reasons we believe that the White House ought to forgive up to $50,000 of student debt. OK. Let’s go to another subject. CORONAVIRUS  Yesterday, Mr. President, was, truly, a sorry sight here on the Senate floor. Senate Republicans, down to the last Member, blocked critical funding for more vaccines, more testing, more life-saving therapeutics that our country needs to protect against the dangers of future COVID variants.  The proposal we had before the Senate was exceedingly reasonable, care-fully negotiated, and desperately need-ed, but Senate Republicans blocked a mere debate on COVID aid, knowing full well of the consequences for the American people. In knowing the con-sequences, Republicans said no to merely debating more money for boost-er shots and vaccinations and research into future treatments. In knowing the consequences, Republicans said no to merely debating more testing. In knowing the consequences, Repub-licans said no to merely debating no less than $5 billion for lifesaving thera-peutics—an indispensable tool for those with COVID illnesses. And why did Republicans say no? Because they wanted to cripple COVID funding legislation with poison pills that they knew would derail this bill—would derail the bill. Let me say it again. Instead of joining Democrats to begin a simple debate on COVID leg-islation, Republicans wanted to kill this bill with unrelated poison pills. This is potentially devastating for the American people. Vaccines, thera-peutics, and testing were negotiated in good faith, and they should not—they should not—be held hostage to extra-neous, unrelated issues. This is too im-portant for the health of our country. The administration, for months, has made clear that new COVID funding is a matter of the highest urgency. Some critical COVID response measures are already being scaled back due to dwin-dling funding. Their message that Con-gress had to act—the administration’s message—was unmistakable. I hope Republicans will get serious about this. It should not be so difficult to do something so good and important for our country. Let me say one other thing. Our Republican colleagues think they may be gaining some temporary advantage, but God forbid a second var-iant hits and people ask: Why aren’t the vaccines there? Why aren’t the therapeutics there? The answer will be that the Senate Republicans, to a per-son, blocked the ability to move for-ward and get this legislation done be-cause they wanted to play politics and inject extraneous issues into the de-bate. But it is not going to deter us from getting this done. It is vital for keep-ing schools, churches, business, and other communities open if and when a future, more potent variant rears its ugly head. It is certainly better to act now than to pay the price 10 times down the line. We are going to keep working to make sure that Congress sends COVID funding to the President’s desk. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. President, on SCOTUS, the U.S. Senate, happily, wonderfully, is on the brink of completing one of the most important responsibilities entrusted to it under the Constitution: consenting to the President’s nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. As I said, happily and wonderfully, it will be the first African-American woman to ever serve on that august body. Any time the Senate elevates someone to the highest pinnacles of the Fed-eral judiciary, the impact literally lasts a lifetime and, often, far beyond that. The men and women who sit on the Supreme Court have the power to render judgment on any question they see fit that comes before them. The consequences of their decisions are seen and felt and reckoned with from here to the farthest corners of our country. So confirming a Supreme Court nominee is, in other words, a big deal to the Senate—one of the biggest deals, in fact. And, before the week is out, the Chamber is set to follow through, once again, on this august and awesome responsibility. But, of course, even though this is one of the biggest deals for the Senate to do in any situation, it is even a big-ger deal now. This time is different. The nominee, the 116th Justice, is dif-ferent in some important ways than those who came before. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, like many before her, is brilliant, accom-plished, and qualified to be on the Court, but never—never before—has the Supreme Court had a Black woman bear the title of Justice. She will be the first, and I have no doubt, in my mind, that she will pave the way for others in the future. The exultation among so many who have waited for this moment—of young girls throughout America who may say, ‘‘I can do this, too’’; the untapped potential even for young people, par-ticularly women of color, who are not interested in the law or in the Supreme Court but who say, ‘‘I can go some-where; I can do something; I can get there’’—is going to be great for Amer-ica. There are many considerations that the Senate should ponder when we are faced with the question of confirming judges. Diversity and representation is certainly one of them. It is a key fea-ture of a healthy and vibrant democ-racy. When Americans of all walks of life come before the court, of course they should have confidence that those who don the robes have the ability to walk in their own shoes—to see and un-derstand their sides of the story. That is why diversity of background and experience has been one of the most important priorities in the Sen-ate as we have confirmed the Presi-dent’s judges, and over the last year, as has been noted, we have made incred-ible progress on that front. Of the 58 Senate-confirmed judges, three-quarters have been women, and two-thirds have been people of color. To be clear, these judges are diverse not just through their backgrounds but in their experiences. More public de-fenders, more civil rights attorneys, more nonprofit lawyers have been added to the Federal bench. After years of the previous administration’s confirming judges who were disproportionately White, disproportionately male, disproportionately from big law firms, Senate Democrats are working to bring balance back to our judiciary. It will make our democ-racy healthier, fairer, and stronger. As the country grows increasingly diverse in this century, Judge Jackson’s confirmation will be a major step to-ward achieving that goal, and I so look forward to finishing the work to con-firm this most qualified, most deserv-ing, most historic nominee. RUSSIA  Mr. President, finally, as Russia’s war in Ukraine reaches an abominable level of brutality—you see these pic-tures of the people, innocent civilians who were shot—young, old, children, men, women—every single American should unite on the side of the Ukrain-ian people and against Putin’s indis-criminate violence. The pictures we have seen coming out of Ukraine and coming out of the town of Bucha are a pure manifestation of evil, hundreds of civilians murdered in cold blood—men, women, children, the elderly, the defenseless, people who were tied with their hands behind their backs, clearly civilians, shot in the back of the head because they are Ukrainians. It is the only reason. It is a genocide. It was called a genocide today by a Ukrainian official. It is a genocide. When these people are shot simply because of their nationality— they don’t have arms—that is genocide, especially when it occurs in the large numbers it has already, individuals trying to live their own lives, targeted to be killed because of their nation-ality. Putin is a war criminal. When Putin says Ukraine and Russia are together after he did this, no Ukrainian is ever going to believe it. Even the isolated Putin must know that, but he is cor-nered. And so he is a war criminal. Any nation that indiscriminately and intentionally targets civilians should not enjoy doing business with Amer-ican companies. But, shamefully, Koch Industries is continuing to do business in Putin’s Russia and putting their profits ahead of defending democracy. There is an explosive report this morning that the Koch political arm is now pushing for the United States to abandon our allies and back off the hard-hitting sanctions the Biden ad-ministration has imposed on Russia. The Kochs are selling out democracy for their own profits. Every Senator—Democrat, Republican—we all care about Ukraine. Every Senator needs to condemn this push by the Koch brothers and call on Koch Industries to immediately sus-pend their operations in Russia. I look forward to every tough-talking Senate Republican to come here to the floor and call out the Koch brothers for un-dermining America’s resolve against Putin’s illegal, unprovoked, and crimi-nal invasion of Ukraine. Senate Democrats are working on legislation to add Russia to existing  laws that already deny foreign tax credits for taxes paid to North Korea and Syria. American companies that continue to do business in Russia should not receive U.S. tax benefits that offset taxes paid to Putin’s re-gime. I yield the floor. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I proudly rise to speak about the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. When I began law school in the fall of 1979, the only woman Justice at the Su-preme Court was a white marble statue on the steps. There were no women members of the Court. There had never been women members of the Court. The motto engraved over the Court’s entrance, ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law,’’ sounded great, but it also rang hollow for the more than half of the U.S. popu-lation that had never seen themselves represented on the U.S. Supreme Court. And it was more than just the absence of women on the Court. In 1868, the 14th Amendment to the Constitu-tion was adopted in core memorable phrase guaranteeing to all persons the equal protection of the law. But the Court, for more than 100 years, refused to extend equal protection to women. In one of the first cases testing the meaning of the phrase ‘‘equal protec-tion of the law to all persons,’’ the Su-preme Court considered an Illinois State law restricting the practice of law to men only. A dynamic, young, feminist activist, Myra Bradwell, passed the Illinois bar exam and ap-plied for a law license to practice law in Illinois. She was turned down be-cause she was a woman. She appealed her case to the Illinois Supreme Court, and they turned her down because she was a woman. And then she came to the U.S. Supreme Court and said: We have just changed the Constitution to guarantee equal protection of the law to all persons, surely, you cannot turn me down in my quest to practice law after I have passed the Illinois bar exam. The Supreme Court of the United States, in 1873, by a vote of 8 to 1, ruled that she was not entitled to an equal right to practice the profession of her choosing. Let me read you a key part of the decision in that case: The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign of-fice of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator. So a wife and mother can’t be a lawyer? So every woman must be a wife and mother? That is what the Supreme Court determined in analyzing the sim-ple phrase ‘‘all persons are entitled to equal protection of the law.’’ Here is a great trivia question: When did the Supreme Court finally decide that equal protection of the law ap-plied to women? 1971. It took 103 years after the 14th Amendment was adopted for the Supreme Court to say: Wait a minute, equal protection of the law to all persons, that means women. In the case of Reed v. Reed, the Court ruled that a State statute providing that males must be preferred to fe-males in the administration of es-tates—it was an estate administration case—the Court ruled, wait a minute, that violates women’s rights to equal protection. Who was the lawyer in that case? A dynamic, young civil rights lawyer with the ACLU named Ruth Bader Ginsburg. So within my career as a civil rights attorney, from when I started law school in 1979 to today—43 years later— I have seen great change in the law’s treatment of women and in their rep-resentation on the U.S. Supreme Court. The nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will make history. She will be the first African-American woman on the Court. And she will move a Court that had never had a woman member when I started law school to a Court where four of the nine members are women. What powerful evidence of the capacity we have as a nation to come closer and closer to the equality ideal that was articulated as our moral North Star in the opening phrase of the Dec-laration of Independence drafted by a Virginian in 1776. So I celebrate the history-making nature of this appointment, but it is not the reason for my support. I support Judge Jackson’s nomination because of her stellar academic credentials, her prestigious judicial clerkships, her dedicated service as an attorney and member of the U.S. Sen-tencing Commission, her well-re-spected tenure as a Federal trial and appellate judge, and the multiple attes-tations that she has received attrib-uting to her fairness and to her char-acter. In particular—in particular—I think that her successful confirmation as a Justice will add two critical skill sets to this nine-member collegial body: first, that she is a public defender; and, second, that she has been a trial judge. That she was a public defender—so much of the Court’s docket deals with issues that are at the heart of the American criminal justice system. There are currently members of the Court—Justice Sotomayor, Justice Alito—who had experience as prosecu-tors in both the State and Federal courts before they began their service in the judicial branch. That experience as prosecutor is really important expe-rience, and it is an important expertise to have on the Supreme Court. But a Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first public defender ever to sit on the Court. And for a Court of nine to share perspectives and grapple with resolution of questions involving the criminal justice system, for that Court only to have people who pros-ecuted cases and not have people who have defended, in particular, the most indigent criminal defendants—it is a Court that doesn’t have the balanced 360-degree perspective that we would want in these important matters. So the fact that she served honorably as a Federal public defender, in my view, is a strong trait for her, but it is even a better trait if you think about what we would need in a nine-member Supreme Court. Second, she has been a trial judge, a Federal district court judge in the dis-trict court for the District of Colum-bia. And that is really, really impor-tant. There is only one other member of the Court now who was a trial judge, and that is Justice Sotomayor. Some of the members of the Court, as far as I know—I can find no evidence—not only were they not trial judges, some of them I am not sure ever tried cases. What does it mean to have a trial judge on the Court? Well, again, think about the docket of the Supreme Court. So much of the docket of the Supreme Court is ruling on questions and controversies, whose ultimate goal is to make the Nation’s trials—civil and criminal trials—more fair: admis-sibility of evidence, sentencing stand-ards, definitions of police misconduct that could either gain or shed sov-ereignty immunity in a trial going on in a trial court, how to impanel jurors, how to instruct jurors, when to strike a juror if there is evidence that the juror may have a bias or prejudice. These are all cases that come before the Supreme Court all the time. And these kinds of cases, it is particularly important to have a Court that is well- represented by people who have actu-ally been in the courtroom and done it. What trial judges have to do is they have to figure out how to instruct and impanel jurors and deal with the juror who may have a bias question. They have to rule on evidentiary objections in a split second; dispose of discovery disputes; rule on dispositive motions like motions to dismiss or summary judgment motions; in bench trials, ac-tually render judgments, which usually involves credibility determinations among competing witnesses. The judges in the Federal system are those with the power of sentencing, the most difficult power of all. If you have not been a trial lawyer or a trial judge, you might underestimate how difficult and challenging each of those tasks are. But if you have had the experience of being a trial lawyer or trial judge, you understand how important they are. I asked Judge Jackson as I interviewed her, tell me how you think that being a trial judge might help you on the Court. She said, so much of our opinions are essentially instructions to State and Federal trial courts, here is how to conduct a fair trial. I think my experience will enable me to write opinions that are more workable; that are more understandable; that are more practical; that are more likely to lead to a result that is fair to the par-ties, but also one that will increase the  respect for the decision making in courts themselves. When I was Governor of Virginia, I did not have the power to put judges on the bench, except in rare instances. In the Virginia State system, I wouldn’t even nominate judges. The legislature would choose the judges, and the Gov-ernor had no role, except—except— when the legislature would deadlock. If the house and senate couldn’t agree on filling a position, then the Governor got to put in a judge or a justice until the legislature came back next year, and then they would have to vote on whether to ratify what the Governor had done. Three times, when I was Governor, my two Republican houses deadlocked on an appellate judge: one on the court of appeals and two on the Virginia Su-preme Court. So I had this oppor-tunity. As somebody who practiced civil rights law for 17 years, as some-body who was married to a juvenile court judge, I had the opportunity to consider and then nominate people to be appellate judges. I decided pretty quickly, as I analyzed who should be appellate judges— and I followed this rule in all three of my opportunities—that I would ap-point a great trial judge. In each of the three instances, I appointed a great trial judge because I knew that that great trial judge would be able to sit on an appellate court and render rulings that weren’t sort of philosopher, king- or-queen rulings that might sound good in a law review article or in a panel discussion, but they could render rul-ings that would be instantaneously un-derstood in courtrooms all across the Commonwealth and be able to be im-plemented by the other trial judges, who were doing their best every day to conduct fair trials. So that is why I think the second factor that Judge Brown Jackson was a district court judge handling trials, multiple trials and motions every day, will put her in such good company as she joins Justice Sotomayor as the only other member with that experi-ence. I will conclude and just say a Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will add depth and perspective to a Court that needs it. As we near the 150th anniversary of Myra Bradwell’s quixotic case, the con-firmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson will make the statue of justice and the engraved phrase ‘‘Equal Jus-tice Under Law’’ more accurate reflections of our Nation’s highest Court. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. \n",

      "Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be permitted to speak prior to the scheduled vote: myself for up to 15 minutes, Senator CRUZ for up to 25 minutes, and Senator S TABENOW for up to 10 minutes. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are moving from disaster to catastrophe at our southern border. Last week, the Biden administration announced that title 42 COVID–19 restrictions, which had provided for the immediate depor-tation of those who crossed the border illegally, will end in May. Now, it is ironic that just as the administration presses for more COVID funding, it is apparently declaring COVID is over at the border. Now, I just want everybody to think about the inherent contradiction in what is being said here. By ending title 42, the ad-ministration says, for all intents and purposes, the pandemic is over; it is over at the border. But, today, it was announced that the student loan pro-gram—repayments on student loans— would be extended until the month of August. Why? Presumably because of the pandemic. There is still a policy in place, Mr. President, if you can believe this—yes-terday, I had the chance to question, at the Senate Finance Committee, Sec-retary Becerra of the Health and Human Services Department about a policy that is in place right now that has not yet been repealed that requires children under 5 in Head Start facili-ties to wear masks—masks not just when they are in the classroom but when they are outside on the play-ground—children under 5, to wear masks. Now, who says that is a bad idea? Well, for one, the World Health Organi-zation. The World Health Organization isn’t exactly a conservative-leaning in-stitution. The World Health Organiza-tion says that it is not necessary for children under 5 to wear a mask be-cause there is no discernible health or safety benefit derived from that. So that policy is still in place. Kids under the age of 5 at Head Start facili-ties still have to wear masks, not just inside but when they are outside. Now student loans, again, have been deferred. You don’t have to repay your student loans at least until August. It has been extended again. These policies reflect a belief on behalf of the administration that we are evidently still in a pandemic that re-quires these policies to stay in place. So the student loan deferral request has been made or is going to happen. They are just going to do it. So they are doing that by fiat. And this rule that requires children under 5 to wear masks suggests we are still very con-cerned about the pandemic and about the spread of COVID–19. Yet, Mr. Presi-dent, title 42 is going to be lifted at the border, which is a pandemic measure. It was put in place as a result of the pandemic and has enabled our officials at the border, Customs and Border Pro-tection, to be able to at least some-what manage the flow of illegals com-ing across the border. Think about that. Think about the inherent con-tradiction, the messages that you are sending—in addition, I would add, to the $10 billion, which was originally $15 billion, that is being requested by the administration to deal with COVID. So you are asking for more funding. You are requiring kids to wear masks. You are extending the deferral on student loan repayments. Yet you are lift-ing title 42 restrictions. Let me tell you what that means. Once title 42 restrictions are officially lifted, the flood of illegal immigration across our southern border is expected to become a tsunami. The Department of Homeland Security expects as many as 18,000 per day to attempt to cross our southern border after the policy is lifted—18,000 per day. That adds up to more than half a million migrants per month. To put those numbers in perspective, in fiscal year 2021, Border Patrol en-countered more than 1.7 million indi-viduals attempting to cross our south-ern border. That was the highest num-ber ever recorded in a single year. Now we are talking about a rate of migra-tion that would lead to our hitting that 1-year record in just over 3 months. Title 42 restrictions were never intended to be a permanent border solu-tion, and lifting them would not be a problem if the President had some meaningful plan in place for dealing with the border crisis that has been going on since he took office, but he doesn’t—again, evidenced by the fact that the President has no interest in visiting the border, nor has his border czar, the Vice President of the United States. Neither has been to the border. Lifting title 42 without a plan to curb illegal immigration is nothing more than an invitation for our current cri-sis to get exponentially worse, which is exactly, exactly what the Department of Homeland Security expects is going to happen. Now, you don’t have to take my word for it on these problems with the ad-ministration’s decision. Here is what one Democratic Senator had to say about the administration’s title 42 de-cision: This is a wrong decision. It’s unacceptable to end Title 42 without a plan and coordina-tion in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and humane process at the border. This is a wrong decision. It’s unacceptable to end Title 42 without a plan and coordina-tion in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and humane process at the border. That is from a Democratic Senator. Another Democratic Senator noted: I think this is not the right time and we have not seen a detailed plan from the ad-ministration. We need assurances that we have security at the border and that we pro-tect communities on this side of the border. Another Democratic Senator. This is another Democratic Senator, a third one: Today’s announcement by the CDC and the Biden Administration is a frightening deci-sion. Title 42 has been an essential tool in combatting the spread of COVID–19 and con-trolling the influx of migrants at our south-ern border. We are already facing an unprec-edented increase in migrants this year, and that will only get worse if the Administra-tion ends the Title 42 policy. We are nowhere near prepared to deal with that influx.  We are nowhere near prepared to deal with that influx. Again, a third Democratic Senator on the subject of ending title 42. Mr. President, under the Biden administration, we have had 12 straight months of border encounters in excess of over 150,000. In February, U.S. Cus-toms and Border Protection encoun-tered 164,973 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally— the highest February number in more than 20 years. And, of course, those numbers only reflect individuals the Border Patrol has succeeded in appre-hending. There is no question that many other illegal immigrants have crossed the border in the past year without being apprehended and have disappeared into the United States. The President is largely responsible for this situation thanks to the series of actions he has taken to weaken border security and immigration enforcement since his administration began. Mr. President, illegal immigration is a very serious problem for several rea-sons. First of all, it is dangerous for any country not to know who is enter-ing the country, who is crossing its borders. Illegal border crossings are not confined to individuals wanting to build a better life for themselves. Weak borders are an invitation to human traffickers, drug smugglers, gangs, and even terrorists. We currently have a very serious fentanyl problem in this country. In fact, fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 45. And where is this fentanyl coming from? It is being traf-ficked across our southern border. In fact, Mexico has replaced China as the dominant source of fentanyl in the United States. There is no question that the worse the situation at the bor-der gets, the easier it is for drug smug-glers to evade detection and capture. Our Border Patrol officers do heroic work, but they are stretched incredibly thin and have been for the past year. It is simply common sense to acknowl-edge that the greater the flood of ille-gal immigration they have to contend with, the easier it is going to be for bad actors to get across the border. So there are real security concerns that illegal immigration represents. There are also serious humanitarian concerns. The journey to our southern border for those attempting to cross il-legally is frequently fraught with dan-ger, and there is nothing compas-sionate about encouraging individuals to undertake that journey, to run the risk of exploitation and disease and ex-posure. Finally, encouraging or tacitly endorsing illegal immigration shows a real disregard for the rule of law. I am a strong supporter of legal immigra-tion. I am one generation removed from immigrants in this country, and I hope this country will always serve as a refuge for individuals seeking a new life for peace and for freedom. But im-migration laws are not exceptions to the principle that the law must be respected. We can and should make changes to immigration laws as needed to address problems or to expand opportunities, but immigration must proceed accord-ing to the law. To suggest otherwise is to cultivate contempt for the rule of law, not to mention how unfair it is to those who have done what is required to come here legally. As President, President Biden has a particular responsibility to care for the country’s security. When it comes to the border, at least, he is failing in that responsibility, and he is betraying the duty he owes to the American peo-ple, who should be able to count on their President to care about security concerns, including border security. We are less than 2 months away from the end of title 42 restrictions and the border surge that we expect to follow. I hope that the President will use that time to get serious about developing a plan to secure our southern border be-cause he owes the American people nothing less. I yield the floor. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today ahead of the Senate’s vote on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. There are few responsibilities the Senate has that are more important than confirming judges and, in particular, confirming Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court is charged with the responsibility of defending and up-holding the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It is charged with the re-sponsibility of upholding the rule of law and protecting your rights and my rights. Judge Jackson is someone that I have known personally for 30 years. She and I went to law school together. We were both on the law review to-gether. Judge Jackson is someone who, on a personal level—she is smart; she is talented; she is charming. I have al-ways liked Judge Jackson. But the re-sponsibility given to the Senate is not to make an assessment on a personal level, but rather to assess a nominee’s record and the kind of job they would do for the position to which they have been appointed. Now, many Democrats in this Chamber and their cheerleaders in the cor-porate media insist that we cannot ex-amine Judge Jackson’s record. They insist, in fact, that any scrutiny of her record, any difficult questions directed her way, and, certainly, any opposition to her nomination must, must, must be rooted in racism or sexism. Sadly, this is a common talking point for Demo-crats. Whenever anyone disagrees with them on substance, you must be a rac-ist. If you are not a socialist, you are a racist. That is their standard go-to. And in this instance, all should acknowledge and should celebrate the historic milestone that would be having the first African-American woman serve as a Justice on the Supreme Court. Given our Nation’s troubled his-tory on race, that is a major important milestone. I would note, though, that the Democrats celebrating that fact— patting themselves on the back—there is more than a little irony in their celebrating that fact because the rea-son that we have not, to date, had an African-American woman on the Su-preme Court—a major reason—is that the Democrats who are so proud of themselves filibustered a qualified Af-rican-American woman nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Her name was Janice Rogers Brown. She was a justice on the Cali-fornia Supreme Court, and 20 years ago, President George W. Bush, a Re-publican, nominated her to the DC Cir-cuit. And Senate Democrats realized that a qualified African-American woman on the DC Circuit was a real threat to go to the U.S. Supreme Court. Janice Rogers Brown is a conservative and a constitutionalist, and for Democrats, that was unacceptable. So Democrats filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. CHUCK SCHUMER filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. Joe Biden fili-bustered Janice Rogers Brown. DICK DURBIN filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. P ATLEAHY filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. D IANNE FEINSTEIN filibustered Janice Rogers Brown. So now, all the Democrats who are celebrating putting the first African- American woman on the Supreme Court have themselves to thank for that because it could have happened 20 years ago. But in Senate Democrats’ way of viewing things, if a Black woman or a Black man or a Hispanic woman or a Hispanic man dared to disagree with leftist orthodoxy, they do not count. Indeed, it was not just Janice Rogers Brown. Democrats also filibustered Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit. Miguel Estrada, an advocate with su-perb credentials, was criticized, as the staff for Senator Ted Kennedy wrote at the time in internal memos that they could filibuster ‘‘because he is His-panic.’’ Mr. President, this was before your time and my time in this body. Here is what Ted Kennedy’s staff told them: Identify [Miguel Estrada] as especially dangerous . . . because he is Latino. That is racism—which the Democrats put in writing. If you are Black, if you are Hispanic, we will target you, we will filibuster you, we will block you, and that is what they did. For that matter, that is what Democrats have done for three decades now to Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the greatest Justices to ever serve on the U.S. Su-preme Court. And yet, in Democrats’ minds, he is not a Black man because he dares disagree with their leftist ide-ology. It is wrong; it is racist; it is cyn-ical; and it is offensive.  What we should be doing—what every Senator should be doing—is examining Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record, her actual record. If you look at her substantive record, it is far out of the mainstream. It is an extreme record. If you look at her record, I believe it demonstrates that Judge Jackson, if she is confirmed, will be the single most liberal Supreme Court Justice ever to serve on the Supreme Court. I believe she will be to the left of Justice Sotomayor; she will be to the left of Justice Kagan; and she will be way, way, way to the left of Justice Stephen Breyer, the Justice she would be re-placing. What does that mean as a practical matter, left and right? Why do the American people care about the Su-preme Court? They care because they care about their rights. As a practical matter, what it means—I believe the odds are nearly 100 percent that Judge Jackson would vote to overturn the case of Heller v. District of Columbia. What is that case? It is the landmark case that upholds the Second Amend-ment right to keep and bear arms, a fundamental protection for all of us. That case was decided 5 to 4. Judge Jackson, I believe, is a vote to over-turn that case to take away our Second Amendment rights, and that means every Senator who votes to confirm her is voting to take away the Second Amendment rights of Americans. Judge Jackson, I believe the odds are nearly 100 percent that she would vote to overturn the Citizens United case. What is Citizens United? It is a land-mark case that protects our right to free speech, our right to speak in the political process to support candidates, to oppose candidates, to express our views, and participate in democracy. Citizens United was 5 to 4, one vote away from being taken away. By the way, in the Citizens United case, the Obama Justice Department argued that the Federal Government has the power to ban books. The case was 5 to 4. There were four Justices willing to go there. Judge Jackson, I believe, would support the assertions of government power to silence you, to si-lence me, to silence the men and women we represent. When it comes to religious liberty, I believe Judge Jackson will vote con-sistently over and over again against the religious liberty of Americans, against our right to live according to our faith, according to our conscience. One of the most precious rights, the very first right protected in the first clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights—that is what our Fram-ers thought about it—is that without the right to seek out and worship the Lord God Almighty with all of your heart, mind, and soul, no other rights matter. I believe she will consistently vote to undermine that right and, in particular, one of the applications of that right, the context of school choice. School choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century. If you care about civil rights, if you care about advancement and opportunity for young kids, for young African-American kids, for young Hispanic kids, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that matters more than school choice. And yet, the Su-preme Court, in the case of Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, upheld Ohio school choice program by one vote, 5 to 4. I believe Judge Jackson would vote to overturn Zelman v. Simmons-Harris and vote to strike down school choice programs across the country. You know, one of the problems with politics today is Members of this body like to avoid accountability for what they are doing. But everyone in this body is on notice that this is a Justice who will vote to take away our free speech rights, vote to take away our religious liberty rights, vote to take away our Second Amendment. And that means every Senator that votes for her cannot avoid responsibility for those lawless outcomes. When it comes to abortion, Judge Jackson’s record is extreme. I believe she would vote to strike down every single restriction across the country on abortion. I believe she would vote to strike down prohibitions on Federal partial-birth abortion, a truly horrific practice opposed by the vast majority of Americans. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal ban on partial-birth abortion by a vote of 5 to 4—one vote away. Judge Jackson, based on her record of being a radical advocate for abortion, will consistently vote to strike down reasonable restrictions. All of those are extreme positions. But if you want to understand just how extreme, there was one portion of the confirmation hearing that I thought spoke volumes: when Senator Marcia Blackburn asked Judge Jackson, ‘‘What is a woman?’’ ‘‘What is a woman’’ didn’t used to be a trick question. One hundred fifteen men and women have served on the Su-preme Court, and all 115 of them would have no difficulty whatsoever answer-ing the question, ‘‘What is a woman’’— not so Judge Jackson. Judge Jackson’s response: I can’t define a woman. ‘‘I am not a biologist’’ was her defense. Now, does that really mean that Judge Jackson doesn’t know what a woman is? Of course not. What it does show is her sensibility that she is com-pletely in line with the radical left that wants to redefine what a woman is and erase it from the dictionary. You know, yesterday, a reporter stopped me. A reporter from a left-leaning pub-lication said he was asking every Sen-ate Republican on the Judiciary Com-mittee the following question: What is a woman? You could tell from the expression on his face he thought this was a great ‘‘gotcha’’ question. I looked at him and said: An adult female human. He looked at me astonished, and he said: Did you look it up? He said, That is actually the dictionary definition. I said, No. I just speak English. If you would like another definition, how about this one: A Homo sapien with two X chromosomes. For all of re-corded history, people have known what a woman is, but Judge Jackson is such a fellow traveler with the radical left that she cannot acknowledge com-mon sense. There is a reason the radical left groups in this country pressured the Biden White House to nominate Judge Jackson because she was the most ex-treme of the nominees being consid-ered. There is a reason they pledged billions of dollars to support her con-firmation because she is the most ex-treme of the nominees being consid-ered. Let me give an example of just how extreme. In the written questions, I submitted a question to Judge Jackson that says: The theory that humans possess inherent or inalienable rights is reflected in the Dec-laration of Independence, which states: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Do you hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights, yes or no? Judge Jackson answered—this is in writing: I do not hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights. That is a radical broad statement. Our country was founded on the quote I just read from the Declaration of Independence, with those words that Thomas Jefferson penned. We declared our independence from Great Britain. We declared that we were our own Nation. We started a rev-olutionary war. We drafted a Constitu-tion based on the proposition ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident.’’ They are not evident to Judge Jackson. She doesn’t hold a position that ‘‘all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’’ Judge Jackson says she has no position on whether you have a right to life. She has no position over whether you have a right to liberty. She has no position on whether you have a right to the pursuit of happi-ness. If you are a modern leftist, if you are a socialist who wants the government to control every aspect of your life, every aspect of your freedom, then a judge who has no view on whether we have natural rights is exactly the kind of judge you want. By the way, to understand how radical her opinion is, you can look at the Make the Road decision. This is a deci-sion in her court, in the district court, that was challenging the Trump De-partment of Homeland Security deport-ing people illegally in this country. The statute under which the Secretary was removing illegal aliens ex-plicitly gave the Secretary discretion  and said that discretion is unreviewable in Federal courts. It was a clear and explicit authorization and a removal of the authority of Federal courts to second-guess the policy deter-minations. That didn’t stop Judge Jackson at all. She ignored the plain text of the statute. She issued a na-tionwide injunction to stop the Federal Government from removing illegal aliens. Her decision was so extreme that, on appeal, it was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit unanimously. This is a left- leaning court, with a majority of Dem-ocrat appointments, and unanimously, the DC Circuit reversed her because she ignored the plain language of the stat-ute. But there is no area that is more extreme than Judge Jackson’s record on crime. This was the central focus of the confirmation hearing, and her record is far, far, far out of step with the main-stream. When it comes to crime generally, nationally, the average for Federal judges sentencing criminals is 45.1 months. That is the average sentence nationally. Judge Jackson’s average is 29.9 months—33.8 percent less than the national average. If you are a criminal, you want to be in Judge Jackson’s court because you are going to get a sentence more than a third less than you will get in the average district court. That is far out of the main-stream. As you know, there was considerable focus not just on her leniency on crimi-nals, her leniency on violent criminals, her leniency on sexual predators, her leniency on drug dealers, but there was a particular focus on her very dis-turbing record as it concerns child por-nography. When it comes to child sex offenders, it is a truly grotesque problem we face in this country. I spent a number of years in law enforcement. As the solic-itor general of Texas, I worked on many criminal cases. There were no cases that were more disturbing to me personally than the cases where people abused kids, where they hurt kids, the evil, sick predators who carry out un-speakable acts on little children. I have to say, when I first heard that there was a concern about her record on child pornography, I thought, come on now, that can’t possibly be the case. Who is soft on child pornography? That didn’t sound plausible. Then I exam-ined her actual record. I examined cases. She had roughly a dozen child pornography cases as a district judge. In every single case where she had dis-cretion, 100 percent of the time where she had discretion, she sentenced the defendant way, way, way below the Federal sentencing guidelines and way, way, way below what the prosecutors recommended, the very liberal DC prosecutors. Now, when this issue was first raised, the Democrats responded: Well, Fed-eral judges across the country sentence defendants below the sentencing guide-lines, especially concerning child pornography. And that claim, insofar as it goes, is true. But her record is not sim-ply sentencing below the guidelines; it is sentencing way, way, way below prosecutors. Then we examined, how does she sentence in child pornography cases com-pared to other Federal judges? Let’s compare apples to apples. When it comes to possession of child pornog-raphy, the national average for all Fed-eral judges is 68 months, a little over 5 years. It is a serious crime with a seri-ous prison sentence. Judge Jackson’s average is 29.2 months. Now, note, the national average sentences child porn offenders to a longer sentence than your typical crime. Judge Jackson sen-tences child porn defendants to a short-er sentence than your typical crime. When it concerns possession of child pornography, it is a 57-percent dif-ference. But it is even more disturbing in a separate category, and that is distribu-tion of child pornography. Distribution of child pornography, the national av-erage is 135 months—11 years—a long time for a horrific crime. Judge Jack-son’s average sentence was 71.9 months. That is a full 47 percent less than the national average. But it is even more egregious than that when you understand that with distribution of child pornography, Con-gress has passed into law a minimum sentence of 60 months. So Federal judges have no discretion to sentence below 60 months. That is the bare min-imum. When you look at that, you re-alize that judges across the country— and we are not talking just Republican judges; we are talking Democrat judges: Bill Clinton judges, Barack Obama judges, Joe Biden judges—they sentence, on average, 75 months longer than the minimum. Judge Jackson sen-tences on average 11.9 months longer. It is a consistent and disturbing pat-tern. Now, why does she do this? Well, when you sit down and read the tran-scripts of her sentencing hearings, which I have done, it is disturbing stuff. When you read the transcripts, she is very explicit that she has clear policy concerns. Under the sentencing guidelines, there is a stricter sentence for child pornography involving very young chil-dren. She refuses to apply that. There is a sentencing enhancement for child pornography involving sadomasochistic abuse of children, children being tor-tured. She refuses to apply that. If you look at what she has said, she said to the prosecutors—this is a quote from Judge Jackson at a sentencing hearing in United States v. Cane—she said, ‘‘[You are] obviously aware’’—she is talking to the prosecutors—‘‘[You are] obviously aware of my policy dis-agreement. I just think it’s very, very hard to deal with number of images as a significant aggravator.’’ Now, what does this mean? There are two other aggravators for child pornog-raphy. One is use of a computer, and the other is number of images. In case after case, she refuses to apply them. On use of a computer, she says: Well, at the time the guidelines were passed, this crime was primarily carried out through the mail. Now, everybody does it through a computer, so I am not going to use an enhancement for a computer. Now, I don’t agree with her on that, but I understand that point. That point is not out of the mainstream. But there is another aggravator, an aggravator up to five levels for the number of im-ages, and over and over again, she says she won’t apply the number of images. I asked at her hearing. I said: So you are saying that somebody who has vid-eos of a thousand children being sexu-ally abused and somebody who has an image of one child being abused—that those are the same crimes, that you shouldn’t punish the one offender more than the other? She refused to answer that question. That is extreme. It is radical, and that is not the law. Her disagreement— I would note, I believe I have 25 min-utes, and Senator THUNE extended—had a UC to change the time. \n",

      "Mr. CRUZ. When it comes to Judge Jackson’s record, it is far out of the mainstream. This is a judge who, as a Justice—the odds are 100 percent, I be-lieve, she will vote to strike down the death penalty nationwide, and she will rule repeatedly to release violent criminals, to release murderers, to re-lease sex offenders. This is a pattern that is highly, highly disturbing. Our Democratic colleagues like to say they don’t support abolishing the police. When you nominate and con-firm judges who let criminals out of jail, you have the responsibility for the consequences of your actions. Judge Jackson’s record is extreme, and I urge my colleagues to vote against her confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. DUCKWORTH ). The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first let me say, after listening to my colleague from Texas, if half of what he said I thought was accurate, I would not be supporting Judge Jackson. For-tunately, it is not. So I rise today to urge the Senate to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. I am so excited about her nomination. Her nomination, we know, is historic—not just because Judge Jackson is eminently qualified for the position. Both Democrats and Republicans agree. In fact, based on her broad range of experience, you could argue she is more qualified to serve on the Supreme Court than any sitting judge. It is not just historic because of the dignified and honorable way she has conducted herself during this entire nomination process. If you think your last job  interview was rough, take a look at hers. Judge Jackson showed incredible grace during more than 20 hours of questioning that at times was incred-ibly hostile and rude. I would challenge any Member of this Chamber to endure that level of pressure without crack-ing. I am quite certain I couldn’t do it. She is eminently qualified, and we have seen her judicial temperament up close. What really makes Judge Jackson’s nomination historic is this number: 115. One hundred and fifteen. That is how many U.S. Supreme Court Justices have served in our Nation’s entire his-tory—115. Out of those 115 Justices, 108 have been White males. Just think about it for a moment. In other words, nearly 94 percent of the Supreme Court Justices in our Nation’s history have been White men. That is a very exclu-sive club. And like many very exclusive clubs, it has tended to leave a lot of folks out in the cold. In a country as magnifi-cently diverse as ours, that is simply not right, and I am so grateful that President Biden understands this. The decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court touch every single Amer-ican. What does the right to vote truly mean under our Constitution? Freedom of religion; our freedom of speech. How are we as consumers or workers treated under our Constitution? Can a public school district force White students to attend one school while sending Black students to another? Can that same public school district refuse to educate students with disabilities? Can a couple be prevented from marrying and spend-ing the rest of their lives caring for one another because they happen to be gay? And can a State override a wom-an’s right to privacy and force her to continue a pregnancy that puts her own health and future at risk? These are some of the types of decisions made by the U.S. Supreme Court every day. And when the Supreme Court doesn’t look like America, it means that its decisions are less likely to take into account the lives and the needs of all Americans. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a straightforward answer when she was asked how many women should serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. How many was enough? ‘‘Nine,’’ she would say. Well, we are not quite there yet—but four? I would say that is a pretty good start. And a Black woman Justice? It is about time. It is past time. You may have seen a wonderful photo making the rounds. It is of Judge Jackson’s 17-year-old daughter Leila. It was from the first day of the nomi-nation hearing. Leila is wearing a beautiful lavender suit and sitting be-hind her mom. The expression on her face is absolutely priceless. She is looking at her mom with such admiration and pride. Well, Leila isn’t alone. Millions of young Black girls and their moms and their grandmas are looking at Judge Jackson with that same pride and admiration. They have never had some-one who looks like them serving on our Nation’s highest Court. And how many of these young girls will see this incredibly accomplished woman and think, ‘‘Hey, that could be me’’? I hope they all do. I will be honored to support Judge Jackson’s confirmation. I am excited. I am proud of her. And I urge my col-leagues to do the same. It is past time. I yield the floor. \n",

      "Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the nomination of James O’Brien to be Coordinator of Sanctions Policy at the U.S. Department of State. At a time when we must keep the pressure on Putin to end his unprovoked, brutal, and illegal war against Ukraine, we need experienced officials at the helm to ensure that we are using every sanctions tool against Russia. As the power of our sanctions has been amplified by working closely with our allies and partners around the world, the long-term success of those efforts will be greatly enhanced by hav-ing a Senate-confirmed official in place to ensure that those coordination ef-forts continue and that we maximize the costs on Russia’s economy. Mr. O’Brien is exactly the type of leader that the Office of Sanctions Co-ordination needs. And he brings im-pressive substantive expertise and pro-fessional background to this role. Mr. O’Brien is a former career employee of the State Department and re-cipient of numerous performance awards. He has served two U.S. admin-istrations as a special envoy, for Hos-tage Affairs, and for the Balkans. Over the course of his career at the State Department, he has led a large and suc-cessful sanctions program and advised on a range of issues, including peace negotiations in Europe, scientific and environmental agreements, and initia-tives to investigate and prosecute per-sons responsible for war crimes. In addition, Mr. O’Brien has negotiated agreements protecting intellec-tual property rights for scientific co-operation with China, promoted envi-ronmentally sound international trade regulations for hazardous and recycla-ble materials, and worked to make public-private partnerships and cor-porate social responsibility an impor-tant element in American foreign pol-icy. As the first Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he helped establish the office and worked for the safe return of 100 American citizens. I have no doubt that he will bring the same dedication and rigor to advancing and coordinating U.S. sanctions policy as he has his prior roles. I strongly support confirming Mr. O’Brien. His confirmation will be crit-ical to enhancing our sanctions efforts at this critical time. I urge my col-leagues to join me in supporting his nomination, along with all of the foreign affairs nominations pending be-fore this body, to advance our national security interests and improve our rep-resentation abroad. \n",

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. When confirmed later this week, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first Black woman on the U.S. Su-preme Court in its 233-year history. Yesterday morning, I had the privilege of meeting with her, and we dis-cussed her judicial methodology as well as her story and her path in the law. Rising up to overcome so many barriers, Judge Jackson’s story and her family’s story is truly an American story. It is a story of hard work and sacrifice. It is a story of commitment to excellence. Judge Jackson’s academic credentials are impressive: graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Law School with honors from both college and law school. Her unparalleled professional credentials and the breadth of her legal expe-rience equal or exceed that of any nominee in recent history. She has worked in private practice. She has worked as an assistant public de-fender—Federal public defender—and as a law clerk at every level of the Fed-eral judicial branch, including a law clerk to Justice Breyer, who is going to be retiring from the Court. Perhaps most important, she has worked as a Federal judge for nearly 10 years, pre-siding over trials and later hearing ap-peals. During our meeting yesterday, Judge Jackson spoke about her career transi-tion from attorney to Federal judge and specifically highlighted how her career as a trial attorney helped her grow into becoming a Federal judge. Often lost in our discussions regarding Federal judges are the people, the people who are impacted directly by our legal system in our judges’ deci-sions. At its core, our court system, more so than any other institution, is dedicated to the idea that everyone— everyone, not just the wealthy or pow-erful—should have a fair shot at justice and that no one—no one—is above the law. The Beatitudes in the New Testament speak to this idea of justice. We have all heard it over and over again: Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied. The power—the power—of our judicial system and our judiciary stems from the integrity and the independ-ence of our judges. It stems from their unrelenting commitment to the rule of law and to equal justice for all Ameri-cans. Throughout her career but particularly as a public defender—a Federal public defender—Judge Jackson has fought for a more equitable and a more just America, representing individuals accused of committing crimes and those who cannot afford a lawyer. All of those cases are difficult cases for any lawyer. The lawyer must be committed to upholding a core American value that our legal system must pro-tect all Americans, including defend-ants, to ensure ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law,’’ as is inscribed on the front of the Supreme Court itself. Judge Jackson has lived this commitment to justice, to equal justice. She understands the awesome power that will be bestowed upon her as a Su-preme Court Justice. She has seen firsthand the impact that a judge’s de-cision can have on plaintiffs and de-fendants alike. It is why Judge Jack-son has discussed how, when she was a district judge, she would often take extra care to communicate with de-fendants in her courtroom to ensure that they understood the complexities of the legal proceedings happening be-fore them. For when a defendant is be-fore the bar of justice, their liberty is at stake, and Judge Jackson wanted to make sure that they understood what was happening before them and what could happen to them. Her commitment to equal justice is also evident by her impartial rulings and the widespread support she has re-ceived from across the political spec-trum. As a district court judge and as a circuit court judge, Judge Jackson has ruled for and against the government, in favor of prosecutors and for criminal defendants, for labor and for business, for civil plaintiffs and defendants. Her nomination received the support from several Republican Senators, Re-publican-appointed judges, and former Republican-appointed officials. She received broad support from law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and other top law enforcement officials, including former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, as well as crime survivors, and other advocates. Her nomination has received further support from civil rights organizations as well as business organizations. Of course, Judge Jackson’s nomination is about more than simply the great support that she has received and her impeccable credentials. Both are important, but that is not it. Yesterday morning, after my meeting with Judge Jackson, she was kind enough to meet with several members of my staff who have graduated from law school or who are getting ready to apply to law school, some of whom have been accepted. She offered some salient advice about law school. I won’t disclose what it was here, but it was good advice. And she encouraged them to keep going, to persevere. Now, Judge Jackson is already today, and has been for weeks and months now, an inspiration to tens of millions of Americans. Her graciousness, her humility, and her legal acumen are simply unmatched. Her confirmation to the Supreme Court will also inspire many future generations, those yet to come and not simply future lawyers and advocates. And certainly and par-ticularly, her nomination and her con-firmation will be particularly inspiring to young Black women and girls to per-severe, as she said to our staff yester-day. The day of her confirmation will be a good day for America. She lifts our spirits at a very difficult time for our Nation. And while we have a long way to go, Judge Jackson’s nomination is an important step to bringing us closer to having our institutions better re-flect the great diversity of our Nation as we strive to be a more perfect Union. I will go back to the Beatitudes again. ‘‘Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice, for they shall be satisfied.’’ Judge Jackson, I have no doubt, will continue her work to strive for justice, to act with justice, as one of the great hymns tells us. She will do all of this as she discharges her duty as Justice Jackson. I look forward to voting for her to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HIRONO ). The Senator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of Judge Jackson to be the 116th Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. As a Senator, one of the most important responsibilities I have under the Constitution is whether to provide my consent to a President’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the highest Court in our land. The Framers carefully designed our Constitution using an intricate system of checks and balances. The Framers designed the third branch of govern-ment, the judiciary, to be an inde-pendent branch from the political branches of government: the legisla-ture and the executive branch. Judges were given the unusual protection—unlike Congress and the Presi-dent—to have lifetime tenure and to hold their offices during good behavior. Judges, therefore, do not have to fear retribution or loss of their office or diminution of their paycheck if they make an unpopular decision. So while the Supreme Court must show a healthy respect for the other coequal branches of government, it must, at the same time, preserve its own independence and ultimately in-terpret the laws and Constitution of the United States. A critical part of the Supreme Court’s role is to preserve and protect the Constitution and to make sure that all Americans are treated equally under the law. The marble entrance of the Supreme Court has etched above it the promise of equal justice under the law for all persons who enter. The Supreme Court must vigorously uphold the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans and pay special attention to safeguarding and enforcing the constitutional rights  guaranteed in our system of government. As we know from our history, the Supreme Court has not always protected all Americans and, indeed, in the past has treated some Americans as less equal than others, simply due to their race, religion, or gender, among other factors. So let us remember the pre-amble to the Constitution, which de-clares that ‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice’’—it is certainly not a perfect union, but I do believe in the words of Dr. Martin Lu-ther King, Jr., that ‘‘the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends to-ward justice.’’ Americans know that the Supreme Court makes profound decisions every day that impact the lives of people across this country. The Supreme Court regularly tackles so many of the controversial issues of the day that in-volve issues such as voting rights, criminal justice, labor law rights, envi-ronmental protection, and many, many more. Turning now specifically to Judge Jackson’s nomination, she would re-place Justice Stephen Breyer on the Court, who, fittingly, she had clerked for after graduating from law school. Judge Jackson has an extremely im-pressive background and legal creden-tials and now sits as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, often called the Nation’s second highest court. The American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Judge Jackson a unani-mously ‘‘Well Qualified’’ rating for the Supreme Court, which is its highest rating. The committee notes that to receive this highest rating: A Supreme Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability and excep-tional breadth of experience, and meet the very highest standards of integrity, profes-sional competence and judicial tempera-ment. Judge Jackson passed all these tests with flying colors during her Senate confirmation process. I had the privilege of chairing Judge Jackson’s first Senate confirmation hearing in 2009, when President Obama nominated her to serve on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. I then had the opportunity to visit with Judge Jack-son earlier this month, prior to her confirmation hearing. It was a real pleasure to speak with her. I am famil-iar with her background and many of her rulings. She is also a former Mary-land resident. We had much to talk about, as she had many connections to my State. Her brother served both as an infantryman and officer in the Maryland Army National Guard, during which he was twice deployed overseas; and he also served as an undercover narcotics recovery officer in the Baltimore City Police Department. Judge Jackson is eminently qualified. In our meeting, we talked about her personal experience and her commitment to equal justice under the law, especially for those who have had difficulty accessing our legal system. She discussed her work as a public de-fender and providing defense free of charge to the most vulnerable members of our society. In this work, Judge Jackson carried out the mandate of the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, which provides that: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial . . . and to have the Assistance of Coun-sel for his defence. She talked about her outreach to our next generation, in terms of talking to students in high school and college, as well as our next generation of lawyers in law school. I am often reminded of the words of my dear friend, the late Congressman Elijah Cummings of Bal-timore, that ‘‘our children are the liv-ing messages we send to a future we will never see.’’ I do think Judge Jackson is having an important and ongoing conversation about democracy with our students. I frankly think she will be a powerful role model for so many who will follow in her footsteps—in particular, women and women of color who see Judge Jackson break yet another barrier and glass ceiling at the Supreme Court. These students can believe that, yes, they belong even in the highest Court in the land and the most elite corridors of power in our Nation’s Capital. We discussed the importance of an independent judicial branch of govern-ment and protecting the rights of indi-viduals against powerful special inter-ests that would abuse their power. I was impressed with Judge Jackson throughout our conversation. Judge Jackson exemplifies the American story and experience. Her parents were public schoolteachers, and Judge Jackson said she was inspired to go into law by watching her father study when he was in law school. Raised in Miami, FL, she attended Florida public schools. She then went on to earn her BA magna cum laude from Harvard University and, later, her JD cum laude from Harvard Law School. She went on to clerk for three different Federal judges: Judge Patti Saris in the District of Massachusetts, Judge Bruce Selya of the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and then Justice Ste-phen Breyer on the Supreme Court of the United States. After working in private practice, she joined the U.S. Sentencing Com-mission as an assistant special counsel before serving as an assistant Federal public defender in Washington. Judge Jackson then returned to private prac-tice again before being nominated in 2009 by President Obama to serve as a commissioner and, later, vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. As I noted earlier, I had the privilege to chair this confirmation hearing for Judge Jackson, after which she was unanimously confirmed by voice vote in the Senate in 2010. In this role, I noted that Judge Jackson often worked to find common ground with her fellow commissioners, who brought very dif-ferent backgrounds and perspectives to the Commission. In particular, Judge Jackson made significant strides to make our criminal justice system and sentencing policy more fair and just. For example, she worked on a bipartisan basis to effectively implement the Fair Sentencing Act, which ad-dressed the 100-to-1 disparity in the law regarding crack cocaine and powder co-caine, which had led to dispropor-tionate and discriminatory treatment of minorities in our criminal justice system. I am hopeful that Judge Jackson can use these same skills of finding com-mon ground with individuals from dif-ferent backgrounds and build a con-sensus as a Justice on the Supreme Court. In 2013, President Obama nominated Judge Jackson to serve as the U.S. dis-trict judge for the District of Colum-bia, and again, the Senate unanimously confirmed her nomination by voice vote. As a district court judge, Judge Jackson wrote more than 500 opinions and considered a wide array of issues that would come before the Supreme Court. She has a real breadth of experi-ence here, including cases involving constitutional, civil rights, and na-tional security issues; administrative issues involving Federal Agencies; en-vironmental issues; criminal law and procedure issues; and matters involv-ing government transparency. On the bench, her record clearly demonstrates that Judge Jackson impar-tially applies the law and precedent to the facts in a fair and impartial man-ner, regardless of her own personal views on the subject. Judge Jackson took special care to make sure the par-ties before her understood her approach to deciding cases, and she issued clear-ly reasoned decisions. As Judge Jackson said in her confirmation hearing for the district court circuit, When I worked with clients as a defender, ‘‘[m]ost of my clients didn’t really understand what had happened to them. [N]o one really explained to them what they were supposed to ex-pect, so they did not know where things might have gone wrong.’’ Therefore, as a judge, Judge Jackson said that she will ‘‘take extra time to communicate with’’ the parties. ‘‘I speak to them directly and not just to their lawyers. I use their names. I ex-plain every stage of the proceeding be-cause I want them to know what is going on.’’ In reviewing her record, I notice that Judge Jackson’s analysis and decision making have led her to rule both for and against the government in dif-ferent cases, both for and against em-ployers and workers, for and against criminal defendants and prosecutors, based on the merits of the case and her application of the law to the facts of that particular case. In her confirmation hearing and written answers to questions for the record,  Judge Jackson pledged to support and defend the Constitution and further pledged to rule without fear or favor or prejudice or passion, consistent with her judicial oath. She indicated she un-derstood the limits of the judicial role and the importance of adhering to precedents of the Court. Just last year, President Biden elevated Judge Jackson to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Senate confirmed Judge Jackson to this position by a bipar-tisan vote of 53 voting in favor in an evenly divided Senate. In that confirmation hearing, Judge Jackson again stressed the importance of courts having ‘‘a duty of independ-ence from political pressure, meaning that judges must resolve cases and con-troversies in a manner that is con-sistent with what the law requires, de-spite the judge’s own personal views of the matter, and this is so even with re-spect to cases and controversies that pertain to controversial political issues.’’ She is committed to carrying out her oath as a judge. She particularly noted that she did not pay attention to who was in the ad-ministration when ruling on cases, which is consistent with her case record, ruling both for and against the Trump administration in different cases. Judge Jackson did a superb job during the recent confirmation hearings, as our Presiding Officer knows, and consistently impressed me with her talents. Not only was she eminently qualified—we already knew about her outstanding qualifications; not only was she in command of all the legal subjects—we knew that she would excel in discussing the law and her job as a judge; but her demeanor in the face of repeated and often outrageous assaults by Republican Members of the Senate truly set her apart. She maintained her judicial temperament throughout this week’s hearing and showed why she will be a major factor on the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson’s confirmation hearing reinforced to me how critical it will be to have her on the Supreme Court. Members of the committee unsuccessfully tried to distort Judge Jack-son’s sentencing record. The record clearly rebuts these charges, as Judge Jackson’s sentences are well within the judicial mainstream, and Judge Jack-son often followed the recommenda-tions made by the probation office. The ABA Standing Committee debunked several of these myths when they analyzed Judge Jackson’s record as part of their review process before her confirmation hearing. The ABA testified at the hearing: We did speak to various prosecutors and defense counsels for Judge Jackson. . . . None of them felt that she demonstrated bias in any way. . . . One prosecutor said, ‘‘I did not observe any bias, and the Judge was fair to all sides in connection with sentencing in all aspects.’’ . . . We asked pointed questions as it related to bias—whether it be to defend-ants, whether it be to the government, and we found no bias. That was the ABA. In terms of the allegations that Judge Jackson is ‘‘soft on crime,’’ the ABA testified: We heard consistently, from not only defense counsel but prosecutors, how unbiased Judge Jackson is. We heard phrases like ‘‘doing things by the books.’’ For example, one prosecutor described the sentencing hearing involving a very high profile, sen-sitive national security matter. What she said was, it was classic Judge Jackson. . . . What really impressed this prosecutor was that after oral argument, Judge Jackson took a recess, went back to [her] chambers, and when she resumed the bench, came out with a sentence that was more in favor of the government. What more impressed the prosecutor was that the Judge’s ruling in-cluded arguments that had been made both by the defense and [the] prosecutors during oral arguments. It is not as if she came into the hearing with her mind made up. She lis-tened to what counsel on both sides said and came up with a sentence that the prosecu-tion was quite happy with. Several prominent law enforcement organizations support Judge Jackson’s nomination. The Fraternal Order of Police wrote: From our analysis of Judge Jackson’s record and some of her cases, we believe she has considered the facts and applied the law consistently and fairly on a range of issues. There is little doubt that she has the tem-perament, intellect, legal experience, and family background to have earned this ap-pointment. We are reassured that, should she be confirmed, she would approach her future cases with an open mind and treat issues re-lated to law enforcement fairly and justly. The International Association of Chiefs of Police supports Judge Jack-son’s nomination. They wrote: [W]hen the IACP chooses to support an individual, we do not take it lightly, and [we] take into careful consideration their back-ground, experience, and previous opinions issued as they relate to law enforcement and criminal justice issues. . . . During her time as a judge, she has displayed her dedication to ensuring that our communities are safe and that the interests of justice are served. We believe that Judge Jackson’s years of ex-perience have shown she has the tempera-ment and qualifications to serve as the next Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. That was the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Judge Jackson has an unusually broad range of support from law en-forcement groups, crime victims and survivors, business associations, and civil rights groups. Former DC Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith introduced Judge Jackson at her confirmation hearing. Judge Grif-fith, a President George W. Bush ap-pointee, vouched for Judge Jackson’s ‘‘careful approach, extraordinary judi-cial understanding, and collegial man-ner. . . . Judge Jackson has a dem-onstrated record of excellence, and I believe, based upon her work as a trial judge when I served on the Court of Ap-peals, that she will adjudicate based on the facts and the law and not [in a] partisan [manner]. Former Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, a President George H. W. Bush appointee who recently advised Vice President Pence, offered a similar endorsement when he wrote that she is ‘‘eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court’’ and is ‘‘as highly credentialed and experienced in the law as any nominee in [recent] history.’’ Her colleagues have given her the highest ratings. Those who know her best, those who have worked with her, give us all great confidence in her qualifications and ability to serve on the Supreme Court. A group of conservative lawyers— many of whom served in previous Re-publican administrations—wrote in strong support of Judge Jackson and said: While some of us might differ concerning particular positions she has taken as a judge, we are united in our view that she is excep-tionally well-qualified, given her breadth of experience, demonstrated ability, and per-sonal attributes of intellect and character. Indeed, we think that her confirmation on a consensus basis would strengthen the Court and the nation in important ways. It is long past time for the Supreme Court to seat a highly qualified, Black, female attorney as a member. As we strive to provide equal justice under the law to all Americans, she would be only the sixth woman out of 116 Jus-tices to serve on the Supreme Court and only the second woman of color and the first Black woman. A Justice Jackson will bring sorely needed diver-sity to the Supreme Court, both demo-graphically and professionally. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights noted: This professional diversity is another critical step in ensuring our courts look more like America. Judge Jackson will be the first justice with any significant criminal defense experience since the retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall in 1991, and she would be the only Supreme Court justice to have served as a public defender. Public defenders play a [critical] role in our legal system, yet they are vastly underrepresented on the fed-eral bench. At all levels of our judiciary, there are nearly six times as many former prosecutors on the federal bench than former criminal defense lawyers, and just over 5 per-cent of federal appellate judges have experi-ence as a public defender. . . . Our highest court should reflect the diversity of the legal profession, and Judge Jackson’s meaningful experience is greatly needed on our Supreme Court. I believe that Judge Jackson will faithfully uphold her judicial oath, which contains a special provision whereby judges promise to ‘‘administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and the rich.’’ I believe she respects the separa-tion of powers and checks and balances in our system and that she is com-mitted to uphold the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans. I will proudly vote to confirm Judge Jackson so she will become Justice Jackson. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. USICA  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about some-thing that is impacting consumers  every day, and that is our supply chain shortage as it relates to semiconduc-tors, or abbreviated here as ‘‘chips.’’ I can’t emphasize how important this issue is to Americans. It is affecting Americans who can’t buy a used car. There is a 41-percent increase over what they would have normally been able to buy. It is really impacting Americans. Why? Because Americans can’t get new cars. They can’t get new cars because they don’t have semi-conductors. It is impacting our trans-portation sector that ships goods. It is affecting our ability on national secu-rity. It is affecting our communication systems. I know that a year ago, we passed this legislation out of the Senate. I am pretty sure that if we would have passed the funding a year ago out of the U.S. Senate and it would have been adopted and gone to the President’s desk, we would be in a different supply chain issue today. I want to ask my colleagues to move quickly at going to conference on this legislation. Reporting indicates that semiconductor shortages may have cost the United States a full percent of economic input-output in 2021. Other reports highlight the fact that the semiconductor shortage is driving in-flation. Yet our colleagues don’t want to help get us to conference. When you don’t have chips, you don’t have trucks to drive. We have an opportunity to invest in American workers and to show inter-national leadership and innovation by going to conference and passing this Innovation and Competition Act. I want to thank Senator SCHUMER  and Senator Y OUNG for their work in a bipartisan fashion to get this legisla-tion before us, to help us move it through the process, and now to help us deliver on what is impacting Ameri-cans—critical supply chain shortages. My colleagues have long spoken about the need to reshore our semicon-ductor supply chain. That is why, when we passed this bill a year ago, we had strong bipartisan support, and we have continued to grow the support for this action. We are here today, though, to say that if we continue to delay this issue, the investment is going to go some-where else; that is, companies are try-ing to figure out how to deal with the shortage. They have a shortage; they want to get going on it. They know that not only is the shortage here today, but we have to double and triple the amount of chip fabrication that we need to do for the future economy. The longer that we don’t get at that task, the more this supply chain issue is going to be exacerbated. So our col-leagues need to sign up for helping America with a critical supply chain shortage issue and come help us deal with this issue. I have spoken many times about the importance of semiconductors. We know that the cost of a used car has risen 41 percent since the semicon-ductor shortage, bringing them almost to the price of a new car. I have heard so many stories from my constituents about this. They just need to get to work. But all of a sudden, going and trying to find a used car or repair their car because they can’t afford to get a new or a used car—all of this has had a huge impact. Yet people here don’t want to solve that problem of moving forward. The lack of security in the semiconductor supply chain isn’t just affecting automotive industries; it is part of critical agricultural equipment. We are hearing stories now about agricultural equipment that had a chip in it, some-thing has happened, and now you can’t fix or replace that because there are no chips to do so. So, literally, our agri-cultural production is being slowed down, and they may miss growing sea-son because they don’t have the semi-conductors. All of these industries are being impacted. In December of this past year, 59 different company CEOs—Apple, Cisco, Ford, GE Healthcare, and many oth-ers—wrote to Congress saying that they supported this important invest-ment in design and research of manu-facturing of semiconductors, and they pointed to the domestic vulnerability of our supply chain as the main reason to get this done. They knew that our domestic capabilities were sagging. Companies like John Deere and other precision agriculture equipment com-panies depend on those chips to maxi-mize the yield in the field so that our farmers can be fed. Chip shortages create delays of 40 weeks or more for new equipment and parts needed to repair those of farmers and ranchers and those working in our important agriculture sector. About two-thirds of the medical technology companies have semiconductors in over half of their products, like ven-tilators, respirators, and pacemakers. These medtech companies need mature chip technologies and compete with al-ready impacted automotive and indus-trial sectors. They know what the shortage is about, and yet we continue to delay to go to conference. If you care about anything in the supply chain and the shortages, then help us go to conference and get this legislation. Medical tech component delays of 1 year or more have been re-ported. Knowing the hard-fought expe-riences of the pandemic, we need to have this issue with our healthcare system addressed. Early on in the pandemic, the aviation industry avoided supply chain ex-periences that we now see with the autos, and they know how much the safety depends on those chips. But now airlines are having to upgrade and modernize, and they also are seeing the chip shortage. This is coming from lots of different people in the aviation sec-tor. Space X Starlink, which is a satellite internet service provider, is trying to provide internet service to underserved areas and beneficiaries of some of the investments that we just made in broadband to the very, very hard-to- serve remote areas of our Nation. They say that the semiconductor chip short-age had impacted their ability to fulfill orders. What more do my colleagues need to know? We have a supply chain crisis. We have a chip shortage. And now people want to continue to delay going to con-ference and getting this done. The aerospace and defense industries are important to our national defense, and they are impacted. In February, the Department of Defense published a report on our vulnerabilities. They said: [The] decline in domestic manufacturing represents a substantive security and eco-nomic threat for the United States and many [of our] allied nations. And yet people want to delay. They also said that U.S. companies are finding it so expensive to build leading-edge chips that they are choos-ing not to do so, especially in face of the fact they can get foreign subsidies. It is 30 or 40 percent cheaper to build a semiconductor fabrication facility in Asia than it is in the United States. And this is one of the things, I think, our colleagues don’t understand; that is, how expensive these facilities are, in the billions of dollars to get done, in the capital investment. And I know some of my colleagues are concerned that ‘‘Why should we help in this supply chain crisis?’’ Well, we know that the United States wants to be a leader in this technology for our own national security issues. As one of my own constituents said, ‘‘if there is a reason we support agri-culture for food security, we should support chips for national security.’’ I couldn’t agree more. I am not going to see the most advanced chips made by somebody else, threatening us at some point in time that they won’t give us the chips that we need for the operations of our econ-omy. We need to build this equipment now, and we need to move forward. American companies know that semi-conductor supply chains are vital and that reshoring in the United States now—as we look at how supply chains due to COVID, now due to Ukraine— have caused national security issues. So these companies understand that being more secure by having the supply chain in the United States should be a national priority. It should have strong bipartisan support. We have companies trying to in-vest, but they also are saying: Is this legislation really going to get done? The fact that it was basically passed out of the Senate and now we are de-laying in tactics to go to conference is frustrating. Earlier this year, Intel announced they were investing $20 billion in Ohio to build semiconductor fabrication fa-cilities. The CEO of Intel testified be-fore the Commerce Committee about  the importance of this investment and the importance of this underlying pas-sage of legislation. He testified that this investment of $20 billion could soon become as big as $100 billion, but not if we don’t pass this legislation. GlobalFoundries announced that it would invest billions of dollars in semi-conductor manufacturing equipment in places in the northeast part of the United States, but they too are contin-gent upon us passing this legislation. When I think about the workforce that is going to be needed to produce this kind of product or the workforce that is going to be needed in cleaner sources of energy, I know that passing this legislation is key to getting the training and skilling of that workforce underway, right now, as soon as pos-sible. There is one reason that Apple, one of the largest sellers of smart phones in the world, announced last year that they would have to bring back some of their production to the United States. It is because the government worked to bring leading-edge semiconductor man-ufacturing into Arizona. This is about securing leadership in innovation. It is about this ‘‘ah-ha’’ moment that everybody around the world has seen, because of COVID and Ukraine, that the security of doing this needs to be done now and invested in the United States. But some people are still dragging their feet. Congress needs to act now and act swiftly to go to conference, to reconcile these differences, and support this supply chain crisis that is affect-ing our economy. Every day that we wait, our companies, our manufacturers, our univer-sities, our workforce are questioning whether we are going to invest in the United States of America. The CEO of Intel told us that Europe has put $49 billion in a chips package, and they had the money available before we had our legislation done. That is right. People listened to this issue of bringing, for more secure reasons, invest-ment out of Asia and back to the United States, but, yes, Europe lis-tened and went and got the money and got the bill done. That is why some people have said: We are not going to be buying chips in U.S. dollars. We will be buying them in euros. This is so important. We must get this legislation done. Companies may test their ideas in Europe. Maybe the R&D is in Europe. But is that what we want? We want to be the leaders of this. There is an entire ecosystem in an information age that is about the next generation of advanced chips that leads to the next advanced manufacturing. If you want our auto makers, if you want our truck makers, if you want the communications technology and the defense people to also have that eco-system, you have to send this price sig-nal now—that the Congress, the House and Senate, are serious about resolving this issue. This is not a summertime issue. It is not an after-the-November-election issue. It is a now issue. Show the Amer-ican consumer that you have concern for their costs and shortages that are plaguing them in all aspects of their lives and get an agreement, and let’s go to conference and show Americans that we can work on a bipartisan basis to address the supply chain crisis. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HICKENLOOPER ). The Senator from Minnesota. CORONAVIRUS  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today on two very important subjects. The first is about an issue that is of vital importance for the United States across economic, se-curity, and humanitarian spheres, and that is vaccinating the world’s popu-lation. I think we all have learned in a very hard, hard way the last 2 years that the coronavirus does not respect inter-national borders. It started in China. It came to America. It went all over the world. Experts have been warning for months that if the virus continues to spread in other parts of the world, new variants could continue to emerge, just as we are emerging and seeing each other again and going to family gath-erings and having people and tour groups come into the Capitol. We can-not let our guard down. American companies have worked with the world to create the most ef-fective vaccines in existence. We put our faith in science, and now we have an incredible vaccine that we can be proud of. And as we continue to ensure that Americans get their shots and their boosters, we know that ending this pandemic is going to require a sus-tained, multinational approach to get-ting these lifesaving shots to the rest of the world. This makes sense from a humanitarian perspective, it makes sense from an economic perspective, and it is just common sense, because we can’t let this happen again, and we certainly can’t put our heads in the sand and pre-tend that, just because it is going on in another continent or across the ocean, it won’t affect us. For those in America who have lost loved ones, that couldn’t even say goodbye to their loved ones, because they were in a hospital, holding the hand of a nurse, and all they could do was see them in the hospital bed over a Zoom screen or on an iPad, we can’t let any of that happen again. And that means that we not only do our work at home and get the vaccines out and the leadership that we have seen out of the White House on that front, but it is also about leading in the world. The United States has long been a leader in global health programs. President George W. Bush established PEPFAR, which stands for President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That program saved over 20 million lives and prevented millions of infections. It was a bipartisan effort that was led by President Bush. The United States has also connected global towns and villages with clean water, thought to prevent malaria, and led efforts to end smallpox and polio around the world. This is our legacy, but we can’t rest on our success and the leadership from the past. We have to lead now. At this point, only about 56 percent of the world’s population is fully vac-cinated. In nations around the world, the individual rate is much lower. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous coun-try, only 5 percent of people are fully vaccinated. Few people would disagree with the assessment that new variants will continue to form—ask Dr. Fauci— as long as much of the world remains unvaccinated, and that makes every nation vulnerable, including ours. And we can do this at such a relatively small cost to what the gain will be—the gain in saving lives abroad and in America, the gain in keeping a sta-ble economy around the world, because you know we export to the world, and we know we are interconnected with the world. So when it comes to beating this virus, we have to recognize that our destiny is linked with the rest of the world. We can’t give up this fight. Now is not the time to cut corners. We have suffered enough through this virus, and we have the needed tools to vaccinate a global population. We have the vac-cine. We just have to get it to the peo-ple that need it. I will keep fighting to get the resources to get this done. We will work with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle until we get this done and vaccinate the world. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. President, a second important topic is in front of us right now, and that is Judge Jackson’s nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I enthusiastically support the nomination of Judge Jackson. I sup-ported it at a recent committee hear-ing and in our committee vote on Mon-day. As a member of the Senate Judici-ary Committee, I have had the oppor-tunity to spend a lot of time with the judge, in my office for nearly an hour and then watching her persevere—that is a good word—through 2 full days of questions. And I know that she is going to be confirmed by the Senate. And, by the way, I appreciate the support of every Democrat for her nomination, as well as of Senators COLLINS and M URKOWSKI and R OMNEY . She showed the American people why she is the person to meet this moment in our country’s history. She is some-one that showed such grace under pres-sure, as so many people have had to do, by the way, in the last 2 years. She showed herself to be a true person, someone that when asked about how you balanced work with being a mom, she said: We are not all perfect. I can’t do everything all the time, but I try my best, and I love my kids.  And she clearly is a shining example of a good mother. She talked about her faith. Even under direct, over-the-top questioning by our colleagues, she kept true to her faith and to her values and to her view of a judge, which is to take the facts and the law and make a deci-sion without fear or favor. She showed the American people why she is the person to meet this moment as the first Black woman nominated to the Court and only the sixth woman in the history of our country. One hundred fifteen Justices—she is the sixth woman. She will open a door that has been long shut for so many, and she will do it by virtue of her strong presence, her skills, and her ex-perience. She will show little girls and boys across the country that every-thing is possible. She was already an inspiration to one 11-year-old girl by the name of Maddi Morgan. I met Maddi’s dad when I was on a walk in Washington, DC. He parked his car, sprung out of his car, and showed me the letter that his daughter had written President Biden when President Biden announced that he was going to make a nomination but didn’t reveal who it was and was inter-viewing candidates. Maddi, his 11-year-old, decided that she would be appropriate for the job. She noted that she would live many more years and so, therefore, would be the longest serving Justice in history. She noted that she could be a voice for kids. She also noted that she lived very close to the courthouse, and she could walk to work all the time. And then when Judge Jackson was announced by President Biden as the nominee, Maddi said this: If I’m going to be snubbed, it couldn’t be for a better candidate. So that little 11-year-old girl was sitting in the hearing room watching as a woman who is truly an inspiration to her, Judge Jackson, answered question after question. And by the way, I am not surprised at some of our Republican colleagues either supporting Judge Jackson or voicing their belief that she is a quali-fied person and a smart person and someone who deserves to be nominated, even if they, for other reasons, aren’t voting for her. I think they are pretty consistent in saying, with the Amer-ican public, that Judge Jackson is qualified. In fact, two-thirds of Americans, according to one recent poll, say Judge Jackson should be confirmed. As we learned during the hearing, Judge Jackson grew up in a family who values public service. Her parents, whom I had the chance to meet, start-ed their careers as teachers. And when Judge Jackson’s dad set his sights on becoming a lawyer, her mom figured out how to support the family while he attended law school. As a lawyer, she balanced work with parenthood. I appreciated hearing about how Judge Jackson would sit with her dad while he was studying the law books and she was doing a coloring book. She, as someone who has been a Federal public defender—the first with that experience who will be in the room where it happens—but also hav-ing many relatives in law enforcement has a unique perspective of the law and a very important respect for people in law enforcement. Her brother was a police officer who also served in the military. One of her uncles was a detective, and the other uncle was the chief of police for the Miami Police Department. It was from that family of public servants that Judge Jackson set her sights high. After graduating from law school, doing very well there, she was a clerk for Justice Breyer. And then as she heads into this nomination after three votes—this will be her fourth vote in front of this Senate with bipartisan support—she will come to the Court with more—with more—judicial experi-ence than four other Justices had when they went on the Court. These are cur-rent Justices. She is the person we need right now. We know that trust in the Court has been fading, and so to have someone that has her legal acumen and back-ground but also to have someone who gets that these decisions aren’t just words on a page; that the words on the page and the decisions you make as a judge are connected to real people; they affect whether someone is going to get healthcare; they affect their own healthcare choices; they affect if you are going to have clean water or air; and they affect whether or not you can actually vote and how you can vote and when you can vote and if you can vote—she gets it. I appreciated her willingness to take so many questions. We talked about antitrust, a subject true to my heart, as well as the importance of the First Amendment and many other detailed questions that she got. And I know a lot of those questions that got atten-tion were the over-the-top ones, the at-tacks on her, but, nevertheless, the bulk of the questions in that hearing got to true questions about the law and her views and her knowledge of the cases, and she passed every single thing with flying colors. At this critical moment, Judge Jackson has the qualities to make sure that the Court and the Constitution, in Jus-tice Breyer’s words, ‘‘work for the peo-ple of today.’’ She has a quintessentially American story, and as she put it, her success is a ‘‘testament to the hope and promise of this country.’’ I urge my colleagues to embrace the hope and promise of Judge Jackson and the hope and promise of this country. Vote for her. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here to voice my very strong, enthusi-astic support for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination and to urge all of our colleagues in joining me to vote to confirm her. Judge Jackson is one of the most exceptional Supreme Court nominees I have met, and I am so excited she is on her way to the Supreme Court. It is in-credibly well deserved and incredibly good news for our country. The bottom line for me is always, can I tell my constituents back home in Washington State that if they ever have a case before this judge, this is someone who will listen, who will un-derstand, and someone who will make a thoughtful, fair decision for them based on the laws of our Nation? And the answer with Judge Jackson is a re-sounding yes. It is clear from her record she has the experience. It was clear from her hear-ing that she has a masterful under-standing of the law and a seemingly endless supply of perhaps unwarranted patience. And I think it is clear to anyone, after a few minutes with her, she has heart, compassion, and a commitment to justice. So it should be no surprise her nomination was met with wide acclaim, in-cluding from prominent Republican lawyers and retired judges appointed by Republican Presidents. As a professional, Judge Jackson’s record doesn’t merely check the boxes we have come to expect from our Su-preme Court nominees: a clerkship for Justice Breyer, experience as a district court judge and a circuit court judge. She also has experience that is less common to the highest Court in the land, and for that reason, all the more important—like her experience on the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a per-spective only the retiring Justice Breyer brought to the Supreme Court or her experience as a public defender, something no other Supreme Court Justice has ever had. This is so impor-tant and so long overdue. Being a public defender means developing an in-depth understanding of the legal needs of everyday people. Judges from these kinds of legal backgrounds can be better equipped to understand the experiences of each person before them to recognize the burden laws often place on people who are living with low income or otherwise marginalized, and ultimately to render more informed, more just decisions. And Judge Jackson’s background is more than simply a resume. It is her perspective growing up as the daughter of two public school teachers, her per-spective as a working mother with two daughters of her own, and her perspec-tive as a Black woman working in a profession where stories like hers were few and far between.  I have no doubt that perspective will serve her and the people who come be-fore her well as a Supreme Court Jus-tice. And while her personal story tells us a lot, the way she gracefully and knowledgeably handled her confirma-tion hearings shows us even more. Dur-ing a confirmation process that a few Republicans tried to make incredibly ugly, she showed the kind of poise and patience befitting a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Over the course of hundreds of questions, she offered thoughtful answers that demonstrated expert under-standing of the law, a carefully consid-ered methodology for how she ap-proaches each case, and an unmistak-able commitment to ensuring justice and upholding the liberties of all Americans, not just the powerful and well connected. And that is so important, especially at a time when so many rights are under attack. We continue to see Re-publicans pushing through blatantly unconstitutional laws on the right to abortion. We are seeing the tragic con-sequences of those reckless restrictions every day. We are also seeing attacks on the rights of workers as they seek to orga-nize or form a union and fight for a better workplace. We are even seeing attacks on the cornerstone of our democracy—the right to vote—as Republicans have con-tinually pushed through measures to block the ballot box and some even continue to dangerously deny the legit-imacy of the last election. We need a Supreme Court Justice who understands, as Judge Jackson once put it, ‘‘Presidents are not kings;’’ someone who understands equal justice is for all, not just the wealthy and the powerful. There are so many critical issues which come before the Court that matter so deeply to the American people—cases about workers’ rights or reproductive rights or voting rights or Tribal sovereignty, climate change, gun safety, immigration, and so much more. My constituents deserve to know the Justices hearing these cases are really going to listen to their concerns, un-derstand their experiences, uphold our Constitution, and defend their rights. They deserve a Justice as thoughtful, compassionate, and committed as Ketanji Brown Jackson. I first ran for Senate because of the Supreme Court, watching the hearings with Anita Hill. I was frustrated that there was no one on the dais who looked like me, no one asking the ques-tions that I would ask; and for most of the country throughout most of our history, our courts have been the same way. They have not represented the di-versity of our Nation—not by a long shot. I am proud to say we are finally fixing that, including in my home State of Washington. And soon, we will take another historic step at the high-est level possible. We will vote to put another mom on the Supreme Court. Ketanji Brown Jackson will make history as the first Black woman to serve on the highest Court in the land, though I am sure she will not be the last, because I know now there are lit-tle girls across the country watching as the Senate confirms someone who looks like them to the Supreme Court for the first time ever. They are not just watching history being made; they are watching a barrier fall down, a path open up, and a new future that seems more possible than ever before. You know, I first ran for office because I watched the Supreme Court process and I was frustrated. Today, I am no less energized, but for a very dif-ferent reason. Today, I am excited. I am inspired, even. And I hope people across our country watching this are as well. I hope a future Senator or a future Justice or even a future President is able to talk about what this moment meant to them and what doors Justice Jackson opened for others. I am thrilled to be voting yes on this nomi-nation, and I strongly urge all of our colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. ROSEN ). The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is an honor to support a thoughtful, expe-rienced, historic nominee to our high-est Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. I met with her yesterday. It was so clear she has the experience, she has the character, she has the commitment to justice needed to be an excellent Su-preme Court Justice. We talked about the legacy and the unfinished fight of Dr. King, how we could never forget that he was martyred in Memphis while fighting for the rights of sanita-tion workers, some of the most ex-ploited workers in segregated Amer-ica—segregated in Memphis, TN. Dr. King understood better than perhaps anybody how worker rights and voter rights come together. It is clear that Judge Jackson understands the dignity of work and that the rights of workers are integral civil rights. Peo-ple think of the Supreme Court as something like an ivory tower de-tached from people’s everyday lives, and we know that decisions these Jus-tices make affect America’s work-places and their paychecks and their safety on the job. That is why it mat-ters so much whom we promote to these jobs. I am confident that Judge Jackson will be a Justice who protects the rights of all Americans, not just the powerful, not just the privileged. She brings with her a diverse set of experi-ences and a perspective that has long been lacking from our Nation’s highest Courts. We, of course, know she is the first Black woman nominated to serve on the Court. She is a daughter of a public schoolteacher. She went to public schools herself—not that common, frankly, on the U.S. Supreme Court— and she is a former public defender. The nomination is truly historic. Her parents attended segregated primary schools, and now, their daughter will ascend to the highest levels of our government. Think about that. Judge Jackson has a history of bipartisan support. Republicans supported her confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals. I am glad a few of my Repub-lican colleagues have recognized those unimpeachable qualifications and are supporting her confirmation this week. I don’t know how anyone could doubt her intelligence, her thoughtfulness, her knowledge of the law, and her com-mitment to justice. She clerked for Justice Breyer. She has shown she is the ideal nominee to carry on his leg-acy of building consensus, in listening to all perspectives. It was an honor to talk with her yesterday and to hear her views. It will be an honor to vote for her later this week. Over the coming months and years, the Supreme Court is set to make deci-sions on everything from Ohioans’ healthcare to workplace safety to their right to vote. If the Court makes these decisions that affect all Ohioans’ lives, I am confident that Judge Jackson un-derstands the importance of equal jus-tice and as a commitment to our Con-stitution, including civil rights and in-cluding worker rights. She will serve Ohioans and all Americans with the same grace and dignity and commit-ment to our country she has shown over the past several weeks—meeting with Senators, speaking to the Presi-dent, and in speaking to the Nation through the Judiciary Committee hear-ings. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING , JR.’S LETTER FROM  BIRMINGHAM JAIL  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is my honor to—this is something I get to do once a year now—it is my honor to join Senator ROUNDS of South Dakota and Senator H IRONO from Hawaii, and then Senator C OLLINS later, Senator BALDWIN , Senator R OMNEY , and Senator W ARNOCK , to join my colleagues of both parties on the floor to read one of the greatest pieces of writing of the 20th century, Dr. King’s letter from the Birmingham jail. I thank those Senators for joining us. Our former colleague, Senator Doug Jones, began this tradition. He did it in 2019 and 2020. As he left the Senate in late 2020, he asked me to continue the tradition that he began. He would have been here on the floor with us to watch and to listen, but he was called to the White House on his work with Judge Jackson. This is a bipartisan reading. I very purposely chose three Republican  friends—Senator R OUNDS will go first— and three Democrat friends, followed by Senator HIRONO . And let me just lay out where we are and what we are doing. It is April 1963. Dr. King was held in the Birmingham Jail for the supposed crime of leading a series of peaceful protests and boycotts in the city of Birmingham, AL. The goal was to put pressure on the business community to end discrimination in their hiring for local jobs. Some White ministers from Alabama would take issue with these boycotts. They said: Slow down, Dr. King. Don’t move too fast. We are for voting rights, too. We are for ending discrimination, but don’t demand too much all at once. Dr. King rejected that premise. That is what this letter is about. It is about demanding justice now for people in Alabama whose skin was Black and who simply could not vote because of the color of their skin. We can’t wait around and hope that problems in families’ lives will solve themselves. It is up to us as citizens, as leaders, as members of our churches in our communities. Dr. King made this point more eloquently and persuasively, certainly, than I can. We will begin the reading of the letter with Senator ROUNDS from South Dakota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate: First of all, to my friend and colleague, Sen-ator BROWN , I thank you for the opportunity to participate today, and I hope to do my best to add a feeling of strength to the message that Dr. Mar-tin Luther King shared in his letter. This is a reading from a ‘‘Letter From Birmingham Jail,’’ Dr. Martin L. King Jr., April 16, 1963. My Dear Fellow Clergymen: While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent state-ment calling my present activities ‘‘unwise and untimely.’’ Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms. I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against ‘‘outsiders coming in.’’ I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leader-ship Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Fre-quently, we share staff, educational and fi-nancial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a non-violent direct action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am here because I have organizational ties here. But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the proph-ets of the eighth century B.C. left their vil-lages and carried their ‘‘thus saith the Lord’’ far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid. Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I can-not sit idly by in Atlanta and not be con-cerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single gar-ment of destiny. Whatever affects one di-rectly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ‘outside agitator’ idea. Anyone who lives in-side the United States can never be consid-ered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grap-ple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Bir-mingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city’s white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative. In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to deter-mine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that ra-cial injustice engulfs this community. Bir-mingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently re-fused to engage in good faith negotiation. Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants—for example, to remove the stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Ala-bama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstra-tions. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, re-turned; the others remained. As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment set-tled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to under-take a process of self purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ‘‘Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?’’ ‘‘Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?’’ We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping pe-riod of the year. Knowing that a strong eco-nomic-withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change. Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s mayoral election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eu-gene ‘‘Bull’’ Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run off, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many oth-ers, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end, we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct ac-tion program could be delayed no longer. Ms. HIRONO. You may well ask: ‘‘Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t ne-gotiation a better path?’’ You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent di-rect action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must con-fess that I am not afraid of the word ‘‘ten-sion.’’ I have earnestly opposed violent ten-sion, but there is a type of constructive, non-violent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was nec-essary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective ap-praisal, so must we see the need for non-violent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and broth-erhood. The purpose of our direct action pro-gram is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to nego-tiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our be-loved Southland been bogged down in a trag-ic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue. One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: ‘‘Why didn’t you give the new city administration time to act?’’ The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the out-going one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Al-bert Boutwell as mayor will bring the mil-lennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Con-nor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resist-ance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their  unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more im-moral than individuals. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-pressor; it must be demanded by the op-pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ‘‘well timed’’ in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-tion. For years now I have heard the word ‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ‘‘justice too long delayed is jus-tice denied.’’ We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political inde-pendence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of seg-regation to say, ‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on tele-vision, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an uncon-scious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: ‘‘Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?’’; when you take a cross country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nag-ging signs reading ‘‘white’’ and ‘‘colored’’; when your first name becomes [a racial slur], your middle name becomes ‘‘boy’’ (however old you are) and your last name becomes ‘‘John,’’ and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ‘‘Mrs.’’; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living con-stantly at tiptoe stance, never quite know-ing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ‘‘nobodiness’’—then you will under-stand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. Ms. COLLINS. I hope, sirs, that you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety over our will-ingness to break laws. This is certainly a le-gitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s de-cision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance, it may seem rather paradoxical for us to consciously break laws. One may well ask: ‘‘How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?’’ The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey un-just laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ‘‘an unjust law is no law at all.’’ Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philoso-pher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘‘I it’’ relationship for an ‘‘I thou’’ relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politi-cally, economically and sociologically un-sound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrange-ment, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong. Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give an-other explanation. A law is unjust if it is in-flicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that State’s segregation laws was democrat-ically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Ne-groes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such cir-cumstances be considered democratically structured? Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading with-out a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segrega-tion and to deny citizens the First-Amend-ment privilege of peaceful assembly and pro-test. I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advo-cate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to an-archy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willing-ness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly ac-cepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law. Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced su-perbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excru-ciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience. We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘‘legal’’ and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ‘‘illegal.’’ It was ‘‘ille-gal’’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate dis-obeying that country’s antireligious laws. Mr. BROWN. I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white mod-erate, who is more devoted to ‘‘order’’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‘‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action’’; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ‘‘more convenient season.’’ Shallow under-standing from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright re-jection. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will re-spect the dignity and worth of human per-sonality. Actually, we who engage in non-violent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured. In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be con-demned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like condemning a robbed man because his pos-session of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precip-itated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing  devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently af-firmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitu-tional rights because the quest may precipi-tate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: ‘‘All Christians know that the col-ored people will receive equal rights eventu-ally, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christi-anity almost two thousand years to accom-plish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.’’ Such an atti-tude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actu-ally, time itself is neutral; it can be used ei-ther destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good peo-ple. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tire-less efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather dis-appointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem-ist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of com-placency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect in the sense of ‘‘somebodiness’’ that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of aca-demic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible ‘‘devil.’’ I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the ‘‘do nothingism’’ of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nation-alist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. If this philos-ophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flow-ing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ‘‘rabble rousers’’ and ‘‘outside agitators’’ those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies—a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare. Ms. BALDWIN. Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has hap-pened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has re-minded him that it can be gained. Con-sciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to understand why he must do so. If his re-pressed emotions are not released in non-violent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my peo-ple: ‘‘Get rid of your discontent.’’ Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled through into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an ex-tremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satis-faction from the label. Was not Jesus an ex-tremist for love: ‘‘Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite-fully use you, and persecute you.’’ Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ‘‘Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.’’ Was not Paul an ex-tremist for the Christian gospel: ‘‘I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.’’ Was not Martin Luther an extremist: ‘‘Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.’’ And John Bunyan: ‘‘I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butch-ery of my conscience.’’ And Abraham Lin-coln: ‘‘This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.’’ And Thomas Jefferson: ‘‘We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . . ’’ So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dra-matic scene on Calvary’s hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime—the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their envi-ronment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an ex-tremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists. I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the op-pressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and com-mitted themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in qual-ity. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of po-licemen who view them as ‘‘dirty nigger- lovers.’’ Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful ‘‘action’’ antidotes to com-bat the disease of segregation. Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in wel-coming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago. But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been dis-appointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can al-ways find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spir-itual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. Mr. ROMNEY. When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom move-ment and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows. In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white re-ligious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed. I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white min-isters declare: ‘‘Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.’’ In the midst of bla-tant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ‘‘Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.’’ And I have watched many churches commit them-selves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinc-tion between body and soul, between the sa-cred and the secular. I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at  the South’s beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have be-held the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: ‘‘What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?’’ Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique po-sition of being the son, the grandson and the great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists. There was a time when the church was very powerful—in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermom-eter that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the peo-ple in power became disturbed and imme-diately sought to convict the Christians for being ‘‘disturbers of the peace’’ and ‘‘outside agitators.’’ But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were ‘‘a colony of heaven,’’ called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in com-mitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be ‘‘astronomically intimidated.’’ By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and glad-iatorial contests. Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the aver-age community is consoled by the church’s silent—and often even vocal—sanction of things as they are. But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today’s church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authen-ticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappoint-ment with the church has turned into out-right disgust. Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thank-ful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of con-formity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dis-missed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment. I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the fu-ture. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Mr. WARNOCK. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation—and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the op-position we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands. Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ‘‘order’’ and ‘‘preventing violence.’’ I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I can-not join you in your praise of the Bir-mingham police department. It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the dem-onstrators. In this sense they have con-ducted themselves rather ‘‘nonviolently’’ in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather non-violent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T.S. Eliot has said: ‘‘The last temptation is the great-est treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.’’ I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the ago-nizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a sev-enty two year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride seg-regated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who in-quired about her weariness: ‘‘My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.’’ They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and non-violently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience’s sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of de-mocracy which were dug deep by the found-ing fathers in their formulation of the Con-stitution and the Declaration of Independ-ence. Never before have I written so long a letter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers? If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unrea-sonably impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Chris-tian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the ra-diant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty. Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood, MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. BALDWIN ). The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, thanks to my colleagues, Senator WARNOCK , Senator B ALDWIN in the Presiding Officer’s Chair, Senator R OUNDS , Senator H IRONO , Senator C OLLINS , and Senator R OMNEY for joining me to read these powerful words today. This tradition began in 2019 when Senator Doug Jones from Alabama, a leader in the civil rights movement, as Senator WARNOCK who just spoke also is—he began this tradition in 2019. And then when he left the Senate in 2020, he asked me to continue and together read these powerful words—a diverse group on the floor today. We come from different backgrounds. We dis-agree on a number of things. We love this country. We know we can do bet-ter for the people who make it work. In my meeting yesterday with Judge Jackson—soon to be Justice Jackson— we talked about the deep connection between civil rights and workers’ rights. Dr. King spoke to labor audi-ences throughout his life. He preached with a unique eloquence about the in-herent dignity of work. He said that  ‘‘so often we overlook the work and significance of those who are not in professional jobs, of those who are not in the so-called big jobs . . . Whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for the building of hu-manity,’’ Dr. King said, ‘‘it has dignity and it has worth.’’ He said that ‘‘no labor is really menial unless you’re not getting adequate wages.’’ I think about the campaign Dr. King waged when he was assassinated. We will never forget that he was martyred in Memphis while fighting for some of the most exploited workers in the country: sanitation workers in seg-regated Memphis. We know too many workers face a similar exploitation today. We have seen, over the past 2 years, how many workers corporations call essential but treat as expendable. It is their whole business model. It is not a coincidence that many of those workers look like the ones for whom Dr. King was fighting for, that they are not the ones in the so-called— his words—‘‘big jobs.’’ When on occasion, a company tries to do the right thing when they announce a pay raise or investment in workers, often Wall Street punishes them. This week, Starbucks—a corporation currently fighting its own workers try-ing to organize a union—announced they are throwing a bone to workers. The company is going to do a little tiny bit less in executive compensation in the form of stock buybacks this year and do some investment in the workers instead, and their stock price went down. The Wall Street business model doesn’t just do nothing for workers— pardon the grammar—it actively dis-courages investment in workers. It has to change. Until hard work pays off for all workers, Dr. King’s work remains unfinished. That means paying all workers a living wage. Sen-ator WARNOCK is still on the floor, and Senator B ALDWIN , the Presiding Officer, are two of the people that fight the hardest for that. All workers must make a living wage, have more power over their schedule, provide good benefits and safety on the job, and not fight orga-nizing a union. That means all workers get a fair share of the wealth that they create. It means recognizing the dig-nity of the communities that Black Americans have built over generations. That is how we bring ourselves closer to the society that Dr. King envisioned where all labor has dignity. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I rise in support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States and look forward to proudly voting for her confirmation. There are few constitutional duties more important in my role as a U.S. Senator than providing the advice and consent on judicial nominations, and this is especially true for the Supreme Court. As we consider Judge Jackson’s nomination before this body, we are on the cusp of a historic, barrier-breaking mo-ment and on the verge of confirming the first African-American woman to serve on the Supreme Court. This is not only a significant milestone, but a moment to recognize Judge Jackson, who is one of our Na-tion’s brightest legal minds and an in-credibly impressive nominee. Before I talk about Judge Jackson’s exceptional experience, her qualifica-tions, and support from all across the legal spectrum, I think it is important to reflect on the critical importance of our Nation’s highest Court. Without question, Supreme Court rulings have a direct and a consequen-tial impact on the lives of Michiganders and all Americans. Issues before the Court include healthcare, women’s reproductive rights, workers’ rights, environmental protections, vot-ing rights, and many life-or-death deci-sions that shape the law of the land. Simply put, the Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for every-day Americans and an important guardian of the Constitution itself. There is no question that a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a tremendous responsibility, and we must have qualified, committed Jus-tices who will exercise judicial inde-pendence—follow the facts—and apply law and precedent fairly and impar-tially, without regard for their own personal views, partisanship, or poli-tics. It is clear that on every single measure, Judge Jackson has the credentials, the qualities, the work ethic, and char-acter needed to serve on the Supreme Court. And she will not only bring di-versity but a unique life perspective and passion for the law that she devel-oped at a very young age. Judge Jackson’s interest in the law actually started as a preschooler, sit-ting next to her father while he studied cases for law school, while she worked on her coloring book. Despite being ambitious and a star student, growing up, Judge Jackson faced resistance. When Judge Jackson told her high school guidance counselor that she was interested in attending Harvard University, the counselor told her that maybe she should set her sights lower than that. Judge Jackson was not going to be deterred, and she credits her high school debate coach for introducing her to several colleges. And then she went on to graduate magna cum laude from Harvard as an undergraduate and cum laude from Harvard Law School. This was the beginning of Judge Jackson’s distinguished legal career. She clerked for three Federal judges, including Supreme Court Justice Breyer, worked in private practice at prestigious law firms, and has served on the Federal bench on both the dis-trict court and the court of appeals, a position she was confirmed to just last year by bipartisan support by this very Senate. Judge Jackson’s experience has also been shaped by representing everyday Americans and hearing their cases. She will be the first Justice who previously served as a Federal public defender, and the only Justice who has served as a member of the bipartisan U.S. Sen-tencing Commission. She will also bring considerable criminal law experi-ence to the Court. Her breadth of experience, her record, and temperament were on full display during her Senate judiciary confirma-tion hearing. Over the course of 24 hours and more than 600 questions, Judge Jackson not only demonstrated why she is qualified to serve on the Su-preme Court but also why she was unflappable, even when she faced out-rageous—absolutely outrageous—false attacks on her record during the com-mittee hearings. During this process, Judge Jackson has not only earned bipartisan support for her confirmation but has the back-ing of diverse voices, including from the American Bar Association, which unanimously gave her its highest rat-ing of ‘‘well qualified.’’ Lawyers across the political spectrum, civil rights organization, law en-forcement groups, and chambers of commerce have all offered not just sup-port but glowing support for her nomi-nation. Former George H. W. Bush’s appointed Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig called Judge Jackson ‘‘emi-nently qualified’’ and ‘‘as highly credentialed and experienced in the law as any nominee in history.’’ Two dozen conservative and former Republican-appointed officials said: We are united in our view that she is exceptionally well-qualified, given her breadth of experience, her demonstrated ability, and personal attributes of intellect and char-acter. We think that her confirmation on a consensus basis would strengthen the court and the nation in important ways. And the International Association of Chiefs of Police said: During her time as judge, she has displayed her dedication to ensuring that our commu-nities are safe and that the interest[s] of jus-tice are served. [We believe that] Judge Jackson’s years of experience have shown [that] she has the temperament and quali-fications to serve as the next Associate Jus-tice of the United States Supreme Court. After my one-on-one meeting with Judge Jackson last week, I was con-vinced that she is extraordinarily qualified and prepared to serve on the Supreme Court, particularly at this challenging moment. This is, without question, a challenging time, not only for the Supreme  Court but also for our democracy, and it is clear that Judge Jackson has the extensive experience and qualifications and temperament and impartiality and fidelity to the law that will undoubt-edly serve our Nation exceptionally well. I am proud to support Judge Jackson as our next Supreme Court Justice, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in making history. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama. UKRAINE  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, Russia’s invasion into Ukraine is changing the global order, the likes of which the world has not witnessed since the end of the Cold War. Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked and bru-tal war—one that left the United States and our allies shocked and en-raged. The global response to Putin’s provocation was a mix of sharp words, hastily delivered weapons, and targeted sanctions, but even as we speak, the actions from the Biden administration are still too weak. As airwaves were flooded with messages of support and solidarity with Ukraine, one major power was very vocal in their support against Ukraine, and that was China. China vocally took Russia’s side very quickly. The two countries share a land border, but they also issued a statement of solidarity on February 4, just 20 days before the invasion. And there is no doubt that China is looking at the Western response to the war un-folding in Ukraine, and it plans to con-sume its neighbor, Taiwan, in the same fashion. Yesterday, an article in the New York Times detailed the lengths China is going to in order to convince its peo-ple that their support for Russia is righteous and their hatred of the West is justified. The article goes on to out-line China’s pro-Putin propaganda, stating: Chinese universities have organized classes to give students a ‘‘correct understanding’’ of the war, often highlighting Russia’s griev-ances with the West. Party newspapers have run a series of commentaries blaming the United States of America for the conflict. China’s political posturing should be taken very, very seriously. The CCP is building the foundation for its future actions. Since 1949, the Chinese Com-munist Party has been eyeing Taiwan and patiently waiting. They have not attacked because the United States and other free nations have strength-ened the tiny island. That is the es-sence of deterrence. We want Xi Jinping to look out his window each morning and think: Not today. Our President’s response to Russia’s invading Ukraine has not inspired con-fidence in the Pacific. Joseph Wu, Tai-wan’s Foreign Minister, recently stat-ed: When we watch the events in Ukraine evolving . . . we are also watching very care-fully what China may do [to us] in Taiwan. Alarmingly, the White House is indifferent to the warming relations be-tween China and Russia. When asked about a recent call between President Biden and President Xi, regarding the war in Ukraine, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, in part: China has to make a decision for themselves about where they want to stand. In July, President Biden’s climate czar, John Kerry, said that he is ‘‘gen-uine friends with China’’ and continued to praise President Xi. Let’s get this straight. Russia and China both stand against the United States. Neither country is our friend— period. Both seek to expand authori-tarian world order and diminish Amer-ican leadership. The key difference is that Russia is a small bully, but China is a huge, huge threat. China’s growing economy affords its growing ambition. China became the world’s largest exporting nation in 2009, and today, China controls the world’s supply of titanium, rare earth metals, shipbuilding, and clothing manufacturing, among others. China seeks to control the South China Sea and all the trade that flows through it. China wants to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency and aims to exceed the military might of the United States. And there is no secret—there is no secret at all—that China wants Tai-wan’s semiconductor industry. Semiconductors power our everyday life. If it has an on-and-off switch, it has a chip. Chips are even found nearly everywhere, from our credit cards to our phones, to the processors in our weapons, and even in our satellites. For the sake of our national security, we need to increase domestic invest-ment and produce these chips on Amer-ican soil. Currently, the Taiwan-based Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is responsible for over 90 percent—90 per-cent—of these chips, one small, little island. Over the last decade, China has made investments in their domestic semicon-ductor industry, but Chinese-produced chips don’t match the quality of those in Taiwan. While Taiwan’s semiconductor industry is second to none, American mar-kets have experienced a surge in pri-vate sector investment and domestic production. In the past year alone, private sector investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing increased to $127 bil-lion, with all signs indicating contin-ued growth and investment in the years to come here in the United States. And that is the way growth and innovation should happen, through the pri-vate sector, not Federal funding. Con-tinued reliance on offshore suppliers for these chips poses too great a threat and risk to the supply chains from the CCP. As we saw with Putin in the years prior to his invasion of Ukraine, Chi-nese leaders are clear about their plans for Taiwan. Just last year, the CCP warned of ‘‘drastic measures’’ if Taiwan declares independence. Taiwan is independent. Beijing refuses to recognize and reckon with reality. To deter Chinese aggression, the United States must have our forces in the Pacific modernized and ready at any time. That is why it was a major win that last year’s NDAA secured funding for a robust missile defense system for Guam to counter CCP- launched cruise or ballistic missiles. Guam is our first line of defense from these, home to 160,000 Americans who are forward-deployed to defend the west coast and our country. Guam is the first island to defend. However, as the CCP has continued to grow its military capabilities over the last decade, our own military has been hampered by cuts to defense spending, leaving our artillery anti-quated and our defense capabilities weakened. President Biden has been no different, offering up disappointing cuts to defense priorities in both of his first two budgets. These cuts most certainly caught the attention of our adver-saries. This is yet another example of how sorely out of touch with reality the Biden administration is when it comes to defense. We cannot—we can-not—continue to ask our men and women in uniform to do more with less, especially with China watching everything that we do. While the world focuses on Eastern Europe, we must remain focused on Beijing. China is watching every move we make with regard to Putin, and they are taking notes. We cannot allow Vladimir Putin’s war to set a dangerous precedent. We must not make the same mistakes with Taiwan that the administration made with Ukraine, and that begins by send-ing a strong, clear message to our al-lies and adversaries that America will always be the world’s most foremost superpower. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ENERGY  Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, in poll after poll, most respondents blame President Biden’s policies for the in-creasing inflation and especially higher gas prices. NBC: Biden’s job approval falls to the lowest level of his presidency amid war and infla-tion fears. In Gallup’s poll, which they dubbed ‘‘Americans Offer Gloomy State of Na-tion Report’’ in February—before the  record gas prices at the pumps were even here that we are seeing today— the biggest decline in satisfaction sat squarely with energy policies. In fact, only 27 percent of Americans said they were satisfied with his energy policies. But, if you ask the Biden administration and congressional Democrats, who seem more interested in finger-point-ing than in finding solutions, the cul-prit changes on a nearly daily basis. First, it was OPEC+ not producing enough oil. Then it was the evil cor-porations’ price gouging at the expense of hard-working American families. Then it was Vladimir Putin’s fault with his invasion of Ukraine. Now, it is oil and gas companies sitting on 9,000 leases. Of course, we have come back around today to those greedy oil com-panies again. But the 9,000 leases is where I want to spend a little time today and explain the problem with the claim of the 9,000 leases. Let’s drill deeper—if you will excuse the expression—into that num-ber to truly understand what is going on here and why this type of rebuttal argument does a total disservice to the American people and our allies abroad. The first and most fundamental mistake that White House spokesperson Ms. Psaki has made is in using the words ‘‘lease’’ and ‘‘permit’’ inter-changeably. ‘‘Lease’’ and ‘‘permit’’ are not the same thing. They are not syn-onymous other than that both are reg-ulatory hurdles required by the Federal Government for a producer to work on Federal lands. Second, it is important to understand the vast majority—in fact, two-thirds— of oil and gas leases on Federal lands are producing. There are 35,871 total oil and gas leases in effect, with about 66 percent of them producing oil or gas. The rest are going through this abused regulatory process or are being held up in litigation by environmental NGOs. In fact, over 2,200 of the leases are cur-rently in litigation, and if there is one thing that liberals love more than reg-ulation, it is litigation. Third, a lease does not mean the rented land contains oil and gas. Not all 9,000 of these leases ‘‘not being used’’ even contain oil and gas. Pro-ducers first have to perform explor-atory work to discover whether their leases even contain the minerals that they are after. Oil and gas producers procure multiple leases because they need to mitigate the financial damage which could result from acquiring only dry leases. It is called a robust port-folio, a comprehensive portfolio. Fourth, before any development on leases can occur, producers and Agen-cies must navigate this bureaucratic maze—this labyrinth of permitting and environmental laws covered by the En-dangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Na-tional Environmental Policy Act, just to name a few, which can take years to complete. Rarely, do these things all get done at the same time. They are never done simultaneously but, rather, consecutively. They each take the number of days they need apart from one another rather than all together. Fifth, just because a producer obtains a lease and navigates the regu-latory hurdles required to permit a well does not mean they can begin ex-traction. They must first secure ad-joining leases for horizontal drilling. You don’t just drill a hole straight down anymore and suck the oil straight up from one silo. You have to get leases from the neighborhood. They must secure these leases and then ac-crue the capital to finance mineral de-velopment. It is not done for free, and it is not going to be done cheaply. They have to schedule the rigs, construct ac-cess roads, obtain pipeline rights-of- way, establish infrastructure to cap-ture the natural gas, and hire capable workers. All of these steps have been delayed by the administration’s road-blocks and Biden’s supply chain and labor crisis. Finally, after obtaining an adequate number of leases clearing all of the regulatory hurdles and planning the lo-gistics of the projects, a company must obtain an approved application for a permit to drill, otherwise known as an APD. There are currently 4,604 Federal APDs awaiting approval from the Bu-reau of Land Management, BLM, and another 162 APDs on Indian land. The Biden administration’s BLM could approve these permits now and enable companies to move forward with the development to supply much need-ed domestic energy at home and abroad. However, the BLM is approving them at the slowest rate since the Obama administration—a fact that Ms. Psaki conveniently leaves out when she claims President Biden is doing ev-erything possible to lower gas prices. In fact, to this specific point, the Bureau of Land Management has State of-fices in places like Dickinson, ND. They have regional offices in places like Billings, MT. That is where the de-cisions have been made as to whether the application for a permit to drill be-comes a permit to drill—until this ad-ministration. They changed that and gave the final authority not to Dickin-son, ND, and not to Billings, MT, but rather to Washington, DC—at the very height of power. In fact, it goes all the way to the Deputy Secretary of the In-terior. Now let’s look at some of the data on APDs, applications for permits to drill, and the timelines. In March of 2020, the BLM testified in front of the House Natural Resources Committee about the Trump adminis-tration’s efforts to improve oil and gas permitting processes. In fiscal year 2019, the BLM approved 3,741 APDs on Federal and Indian lands. The average APD processing time for a single appli-cation dropped from 139 days in fiscal year 2016 to just 44 days in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2021, which included 4 months of the Trump administration, APD approval times shot back up to 89 days, doubling the amount of time. This is yet another example of the Trump administration’s energy success being eliminated by the Biden adminis-tration’s incompetence. The Biden administration approved just 97 permits for oil and natural gas wells across Federal lands in January of this year—a significant plunge from the 643 issued in April of last year. All of the leases in the world don’t matter if you can’t get a permit to drill on them even if, in fact, there is oil—and you don’t even know that for sure. On top of the regulatory hurdles, industry considerations, supply chain issues, and labor shortages, producers must have certainty that their prod-ucts can reach the global market. A key aspect of reaching the global mar-ket, of course, and reducing the Euro-pean Union’s reliance on dirty Russian gas are the U.S. liquefied natural gas terminals, or LNG export terminals. As of March 16, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy had 16 applications pending or under review for increasing U.S. LNG exports. If Secretary Granholm were to sign off on or were to streamline the review of these appli-cations, we could increase our export capacity to help our allies abroad and grow our economy right here at home. The Biden administration has extended its onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing ban quarter after quarter despite being required by the Mineral Leasing Act to conduct quarterly lease sales. At this point in the Obama ad-ministration, they had held 35 onshore lease sales—35 under Barack Obama— and that is not all. The Biden administration is actively working to starve the fossil fuel indus-try of financial capital in order to push them out of existence. That is right. They keep talking about the supply and the demand; yet they crush the supply by starving it of the capital that it needs. This is capital-intensive stuff. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a pro-posed rule on climate disclosure—cli-mate disclosure. This authority of forc-ing publicly traded companies to de-velop and disclose their risks from cli-mate change is not in the purview of the SEC. They don’t have the author-ity to do that. Congress has never passed a law granting them new au-thority in this space. It only serves to further discourage investment in do-mestic energy development and to pre-vent American energy independence, a critical tool for peace and the reduc-tion of global emissions. Now, isn’t that ironic? The Biden administration is succeeding in its mission to destroy any chance to once again be energy inde-pendent. Their radical nominees, ac-tions in the courtroom, regulatory schemes, budget proposals, and foot- dragging exude hostility toward fossil fuels, inflicting a distinct chilling ef-fect on the oil and gas industry. I have talked to a number of producers in North Dakota, and they are  capital-starved. If the right messages were being sent to the markets, we could pick up another 200,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil per day. In January of 2022—this year—North Dakota pro-duced 1.1 million barrels per day. To put this in context, Europe imports 2.3 million barrels per day from Russia. At North Dakota’s peak, we produced 1.5 million barrels per day. North Dakota alone could provide two-thirds of the product Europe imports from Russia. It would be cleaner than Russian oil, and it would lessen Putin’s malign leverage over Europe and, really, the rest of the world. Investors in domestic oil and gas have to receive the right market sig-nals in order to invest their capital. The administration seems to believe energy production is simply a switch you turn on or a valve you turn when you need it. Then, if you don’t need it, you just turn it off—no harm, no foul. It is very capital-intensive, as I said, and it is reliant on regulatory cer-tainty. I am not talking about 6 days of certainty or 6 months of certainty but more like 6 years of certainty. No sane energy CEO would invest millions or billions of dollars in a project with the backdrop of an administration that is seeking to ‘‘transition’’ them out of ex-istence within months. Let’s take a walk down memory lane on some of the signals this administra-tion has sent to the industry. First, the President himself said during a campaign stop in 2019: I guarantee you, I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel, and I am not going to cooperate with them. Well, congratulations, Mr. President. You kept the promise. Secretary Granholm appeared in a video and called for leaving fossil fuels ‘‘in the ground,’’ she said. She then spoke to reporters at the Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks, ND. It is an exceptional organization at the forefront of pro-moting carbon capture and other inno-vative solutions to reduce CO2emissions. During her comments, she proclaimed the United States doesn’t—get this now. The Secretary of Energy pro-claimed, We don’t have ‘‘much moral authority’’ to criticize China over its emissions. We, the United States of America, don’t have moral authority over China? Really, Madam Secretary? That is what you believe about the country you serve? How about the climate czar John Kerry? He flies around the world while making outlandish comments like ‘‘the United States won’t have coal in 2030,’’ and he discourages the world from buy-ing our products—U.S. energy—while fanning the flames of radicalism and proclaiming Ukrainian war refugees are nothing compared to climate refu-gees. It is like he is the bishop of the Church of Climatology or something. He has even expressed concern that the pesky war crimes that are going on over there by Vladimir Putin are taking the focus away from the real trag-edy: climate change. Then he gets in his jet and flies home. Meanwhile, recent reports indicate the administration has turned to des-pots, like Iran and Venezuela, instead of to producers right here in America in order to help bring the Biden infla-tion under control by producing more of their dirty oil instead of our cleaner production. It makes no sense, and it is offensive to every American worker. We have a geopolitical opportunity right now to cut Putin’s malign influ-ence, and we should be taking full ad-vantage of it. What we ought to be doing is encouraging production not just with our rhetoric but with our ac-tions. Producing more U.S. oil and gas will—believe it or not, proclaim it or deny it as it is the truth—will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Now, if you don’t want to take my word for it or trust the extensive stud-ies, science, and documentation of this fact, Biden EPA Administrator Michael Regan, just last week, told the Finan-cial Times that recent calls for in-creased oil output are compatible—get this now, this is from Biden EPA Ad-ministrator Regan—with goals to cut CO2emissions. In fact, he specifically said: These are not mutually exclusive goals. Administrator Regan is exactly right. Producing more U.S. oil and gas will reduce the West’s reliance on dirti-er fuels from our adversaries. Doing so also avoids unilaterally disarming our economy and losing ourselves to a 2050 fantasy that has come straight up to being a 2022 reality. Some in the Biden administration may finally be starting to understand: Energy security is na-tional security and economic security. And so I say: Let’s make the world safer, let’s make the world cleaner, and let’s unleash American energy produc-tion. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HICKENLOOPER ). The Senator from Florida. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, in my 8 years as Governor, I had the opportunity to appoint more than 400 Floridians to the bench. I interviewed thousands of applicants for these seats, and my standards in each of those interviews were the same. I asked them if they understood that they intended to be part of the judiciary and not part of the legislature. And I asked them if they intended to interpret the law and enforce the law but not make new laws. If they couldn’t convince me that they believed that was their duty as a mem-ber of the judicial branch, then I wouldn’t appoint them. We need qualified jurists committed to fairly and accurately interpreting our Constitution and our laws as they are written, not activist judges who will rewrite the laws according to their own policy preferences. Now, I have had the chance to meet with Judge Jackson. We had a nice conversation, and she seems like a nice person. But I have very serious con-cerns about her record as a Federal judge, which includes numerous in-stances of the type of judicial activism that we cannot and should not tolerate from the Federal judiciary. The fact is that Judge Jackson has written only two appellate opinions in her current position. So we have no evidence of how she will approach seri-ous constitutional issues as an appel-late judge. And she has refused to dis-close how she would interpret the Con-stitution as a Supreme Court Justice, despite being repeatedly and directly asked by Senators on the Judiciary Committee. And while serving as a district court judge, she had a high rate of being re-versed on appeal for applying the wrong legal standards, exceeding her authority, or simply ignoring clear law in her decisions. And a peek into her history shows an alarming pattern of being weak on sex offenders, including easier sentences in child pornography cases. Judge Jack-son imposed sentences that were 47 per-cent shorter than the national average in cases of child pornography distribu-tion, and 57 percent shorter than the national average in cases of child por-nography possession. She has even apologized from the bench when issuing such sentences—not to the victims of those heinous crimes. Of course, they never got an apology. She apologized to the offenders for the ‘‘anguish’’ the sentences for their horrific crimes would cause them. What about the anguish of their victims—innocent children? These are individuals who harm children. They don’t deserve easy sen-tences or our sympathies. And this sympathy for child predators has consequences. We recently learned that a child rapist, someone to whom Judge Jackson gave a very le-nient sentence, sexually abused an-other victim after his light sentence. Had Judge Jackson given him the sen-tence he deserved and the one that the prosecution recommended, he would have been in prison, not out in the streets. These are crimes that Judge Jackson has the power to prevent, but she has chosen every time to give these gross criminals easier sentences. That is why I have joined Senator HAWLEY to introduce the Protect Act, which protects children from sexual exploitation by enhancing the penalties for possessing child pornography and preventing judges from sentencing offenders below Federal guidelines. Our communities must be protected from sick individ-uals who exploit and victimize chil-dren, and also from liberal activist judges who abuse their sentencing guidelines to let offenders off the hook. Federal sentencing guidelines for these heinous crimes are critical, and we  must ensure guidelines are strictly enforced. I hope the Senate quickly passes this good bill. We can’t have a soft-on-crime Justice on the Supreme Court, and we can’t have activist judges in the highest Court in the land. I also don’t think it is too much for the nominee to the highest Court in the land to be able to say what a woman is or to take a stand against partisan Court packing, which even lib-eral Justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have done. We have the right to be concerned and de-mand answers on behalf of the Amer-ican people. I think our country de-serves better. That is why I can’t support the nomination of Judge Jackson to the Su-preme Court. I am committed to giving the American people qualified judges who understand their role in govern-ment and who apply the law as it is written, not as they want it to be. It is a simple standard, and it is one that Floridians expect. Unfortunately, based on my best assessment of her record on the bench, that is unfortu-nately not the case with Judge Jack-son. The Democratic Party needs to understand that the Supreme Court is not just another institution to infiltrate with their leftist ideology. I have no hope that they will, but, until they do, I will continue fighting to uphold the Constitution and ensure that there re-mains a separation of powers between branches of Government, and that judges who are appointed to the bench understand that they are there to in-terpret the law, not to make the law. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, throughout 2 days of questioning in front of the Judiciary Committee on which I sit, Judge Jackson proved, without a shadow of a doubt, what we all knew to be true: She is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of our country. Judge Jackson has the intellect, the integrity, and the temperament befit-ting an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and she doesn’t have an ideological axe to grind. Judge Jackson is exceptionally qualified and well regarded across the political spec-trum. And yet not a single Republican voted to advance Judge Jackson’s nom-ination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and only three Republicans have publicly expressed support for her. So I ask my Republican colleagues: What is it going to take? What is it going to take to put politics aside to support a nominee like Judge Jackson? Because, clearly, intelligence, extraor-dinary breadth of experience, and sup-port from prominent conservatives— conservatives—did not suffice. Clearly, a candidate who has support from orga-nizations from across the political spectrum—from the Black and Hispanic U.S. Chambers of Commerce to the National Education Association, with thousands of teachers; to the Fra-ternal Order of Police, the largest po-lice union—they would not be sup-porting somebody who is soft on crime—to child advocacy groups that would not be supporting her, either, if she was not being appropriate in her sentencing of child pornography de-fendants. So even with this breadth of support, she didn’t make the cut with the Republicans on the Judiciary Com-mittee. So, clearly, a nominee who was uniformly called ‘‘brilliant,’’ ‘‘beyond reproach,’’ ‘‘first rate,’’ and ‘‘impec-cable’’ by her colleagues across the Na-tion was not enough. So, truly, what will it take? Sadly, some of my Republican colleagues resorted to unfounded and mis-leading attacks in an unsuccessful at-tempt to smear her character. To high-light how ridiculous the attacks around the sentencing of child pornog-raphy offenses were, I asked Judge Jackson about the history of the sen-tencing guidelines for these crimes and the concerns that these guidelines do not reflect what is happening with child pornography offenses. And these facts bear repeating. A decade ago, the U.S. Sentencing Com-mission first addressed the issue of sen-tencing in this area. Even way back then, only 40 percent of convicted of-fenders were receiving sentences within the guidelines. Now, 10 years later, even fewer offenders are receiving sen-tences within the guidelines. In 2019, just 30 percent of non-production of-fenders were sentenced within the guidelines. In the DC Circuit, in which Jackson served, the average goes down to just 20 percent of offenders. This puts Judge Jackson well within the mainstream in her sentencing in this area. She is not an outsider. I named numerous other judges nominated by President Trump and sup-ported by the Republicans on the Judi-ciary Committee who have also sen-tenced offenders to sentences well below the sentencing guidelines. So these judges also expressed concern about how the sentencing guidelines do not reflect the circumstances in the child pornography cases of today. I will repeat this. Judge Jackson is a mainstream judge. She has issued deci-sions and sentences similar to other judges across the Nation, including those nominated by both Republicans and Democratic Presidents. Despite some of my Republican colleagues’ at-tempts to distort the truth to get more likes on Twitter, what Americans across the country saw was an incred-ibly impressive, highly qualified indi-vidual demonstrate that she has the in-tellect and the temperament to serve on our highest Court. Throughout the course of this week, Americans also learned about her character. I was particularly moved to hear the testimony of an individual who has known Judge Jackson for nearly 38 years—when they were in elementary school. He said, in part: Ketanji’s incandescent brilliance was obvious to all of us from day one. But even more importantly, she has always been one of the kindest, warmest, most humble and down-to- earth people I have ever met. All this, while still possessing boundless charisma, drive, maturity, and grace. These qualities, apparently from a young age, have clearly guided her throughout her life and her career, par-ticularly when it comes to treating every single person she encounters with dignity and respect. During the hearing, I asked Judge Jackson the same two questions on sexual assault and harassment that I ask of all nominees—male and female. In follow-up questioning, I named judges who had committed such mis-conduct and asked Judge Jackson what she does to ensure her court is a safe and inclusive place to work. After Judge Jackson’s hearing concluded, a woman who had clerked for one of the judges I named who had engaged in this kind of harassing behavior reached out to me. And this is a person who had clerked for one of the judges that I had named. During her clerkship with this judge, she endured extreme and perva-sive sexual harassment. She came forth publicly about this judge’s conduct, an experience she described as ‘‘a harrowing ordeal.’’ She went on to a second clerkship, this time for Judge Jackson. In Judge Jackson’s court, she said, she was treated like a valued and talented em-ployee who could make meaningful contributions to the law. She says clerking for Judge Jackson was the most meaningful professional experi-ence she has ever had. She stated: Judge Jackson is the reason I am still a lawyer. I have no doubt I would have left the profession were it not for the way she treat-ed me the year after my ordeal. Judge Jackson is exactly the kind of judge and individual we need on the U.S. Supreme Court: experienced, even-handed, with dignity, integrity, and humanity. Moreover, Judge Jackson is not just extremely qualified to serve on the Supreme Court; her nomination is a historic one. The Supreme Court has existed for over 233 years, and of the 115 Justices in the history of the Court, only 5 of them have been women, only 2 have been Black, and not a single one has been a Black woman. This is the Court that has decided cases that have had sweeping impacts on our lives, includ-ing decisions that have solidified rights for LGBTQ-plus people, empowered women, strengthened unions, and more. But this is also the same Court that has throughout the course of his-tory upheld slavery, Jim Crow, and the unlawful internment—incarceration— of Japanese Americans in World War II. So it is about time. It is about time we have a highly qualified, highly ac-complished Black woman on the Su-preme Court. It is about time our high-est Court better reflects the country it  serves. It is about time that Black women and girls across the country can finally see someone who looks like them sitting on the highest Court, making decisions that will impact their lives—our lives. And they will know that the possibility is there for them. I close by noting that during the hearing, Judge Jackson told the com-mittee that as a freshman at Harvard, she wondered whether she could fit in or whether she could make it, and a Black woman she didn’t know leaned into her as they were walking by, prob-ably in Harvard Yard, and said to Judge Jackson—she wasn’t a judge then: ‘‘Persevere.’’ That is something that a lot of us can relate to: persever-ance, including myself, who came to this country as a poor immigrant kid, persevering to learn the language, to learn the culture of a country I knew nothing about. Judge Jackson being on the Supreme Court would send such a powerful message of perseverance to everyone in this country. I will be honored to vote to confirm Judge Jackson. I look forward to call-ing her Justice Jackson. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am on the floor of the U.S. Senate today to congratulate and to commend the Uni-versity of Kansas men’s basketball team on its national championship vic-tory. This is KU’s fourth NCAA na-tional championship title, the second under the tenure of Hall of Fame Head Coach Bill Self. The University of Kansas’s men’s basketball program boasts a storied history and track record of excellence and success, and the inventor of the game of basketball, Dr. James Naismith, served as the program’s first coach. KU can also now boast having the most NCAA victories of any Division I basketball program in the country in addition to now four—four—NCAA championships. It is moments like this that Kansans remember forever. Whether you are watching the game from your living room, on the jumbotron at Allen Field-house, or from your favorite hangout on Mass Street, 10, 20, 30 years from now, Kansans from across the country will remember where they were on April 4, 2022, when KU clinched the na-tional title in a nail-biting game against North Carolina’s Tar Heels. It was the KU men’s basketball team that inspired me to go to the Univer-sity of Kansas when I was in high school. I am a first-generation college graduate, and the University of Kansas was probably not the place that most of my peers and friends from my small town in Northwest Kansas went to. But, no, it wasn’t because I was re-cruited to play basketball for the bas-ketball team; it was that I had the op-portunity to attend on my first visit to the University of Kansas a basketball game in Allen Fieldhouse. From that one game, I knew this was where I wanted to go to college. The energy and excitement of KU basketball in-spired me, encouraged me, caused me to wonder—and I think it is true of countless others, to decide they wanted to be a Jayhawk. On Monday night, KU rallied to overcome a deficit of 15 points at halftime to beat North Carolina 72 to 69—the largest comeback in an NCAA basket-ball national championship game. I am not sure what Coach Bill Self—but I am going to ask him—I am not sure what Coach Self said to his players in the locker room during that halftime, but in true Kansas fashion, the KU Jayhawks came back and beat the odds to clinch the championship. The team showed tremendous heart, determina-tion, and resolve in that comeback vic-tory. KU’s Ochai Agbaji scored 12 points and was named ‘‘Most Outstanding Player’’ of the Final Four. Kansas forward David McCormack scored 15 points and had 10 rebounds and made 2 critical baskets late in the game. Kansas forward Jalen Wilson scored 15 points and had 4 rebounds. Kansas guard Remy Martin contributed 14 points to help the Jayhawks se-cure the title. Kansas guard Christian Braun of Burlington, KS—a smalltown, middle-of- the-State native—scored 12 points and had 12 rebounds, demonstrating to other smalltown athletes like him that they, too, could be a star in the Na-tion’s biggest tournament in college basketball. Jordan Juenemann, a former walk-on for the Jayhawks men’s basketball team from my hometown of Hays, noted that this 2022 championship team might not be the best according to the stats, but they played like a team. They care about the game, and they care about each other. Only a team that sees the glass half full could come back after being down 16 points and clinch the victory. This speaks to the team’s perseverance and belief in themselves. Coach Keith Riley, a basketball coach from Hill City, KS, in the west-ern part of our State—I visited with him the other day, and he pointed out to me the lesson that kids around the State will take away from Monday night: You may not always have all of the best players on the court at the same time, and you may not have all the talent that is out there on that court, but you can still find ways to be successful because of how hard you work. My guess is that kids, ever since Monday, back home in Kansas and maybe across the country, are in their driveway, they are at the school bas-ketball court, and they are shooting free throws or 3-point shots one after another. It inspires us to know that we can do more, and the University of Kansas basketball team is inspiring kids today to go out and work harder. I commend these players and the entire Kansas Jayhawks men’s basketball team, as well as the coaches and staff, for their hard work which culminated in this victory. While these young men on the team may be known for their talent on the court, many should be recognized for the adversity they faced off court. Dajuan Harris, KU’s point guard, has overcome tremendous loss in his 21 years. He lost both his father and his brother just a few years apart, and Sunday night, he came out and he played for them. These young men came to college to play some great basketball, but along the way, they are learning how to give back to their community. At Christ-mastime, this team goes to the local Walmart and purchases Christmas pre-sents for families who might be facing financial hardship. They learn the im-portant lesson of giving back to their community. Finally, to Coach Bill Self, I know you are probably still feeling that very deep loss—and maybe even more so on Monday night—of your father, who died just recently—Bill Self, Sr.—but you can be sure he is smiling down with pride on you and your whole team. You took his advice. He advised you: Don’t worry about the mules, just load the wagon. As a graduate of the University of Kansas, as a Kansan, I share the excite-ment of Jayhawks fans across the world in Sunday night’s stunning achievement, and I am pleased to in-troduce this resolution with Senator MARSHALL to honor this achievement. To my fellow Jayhawks, ‘‘Rock Chalk.’’ Mr. President, I am pleased that on such a bipartisan basis, in cooperation between Republicans and Democrats— something I know Kansans and Ameri-cans don’t see enough of—this resolu-tion normally would take a few more days than it has taken to get to the U.S. Senate this week. I am pleased that both the Republican and Demo-crat leadership and their staff worked with us in cooperation to be able to commend the Jayhawks this early this week. So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consideration of S. Res. 578, which is at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 578) commending and congratulating the University of Kansas  Jayhawks men’s basketball team for winning the 2022 National Collegiate Athletic Asso-ciation Basketball National Championship. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. MORAN. With a neighboring Coloradan in the chair and a former part of the Big 12 Conference, Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening ac-tion or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 578) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) Mr. MORAN. Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I stand here to proudly support Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Nation has had the opportunity to watch Judge Jackson during her confirmation hearing 2 weeks ago and see firsthand the temperament, knowl-edge of the law, and qualifications she brings to the highest Court in the land. She will be a fair and impartial jurist, just as she has proven herself to be on the district court and on the DC Cir-cuit Court of Appeals. President Biden made a commitment before he was elected to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson’s historic nomi-nation is long overdue. It was in my home State of New York where Constance Baker Motley became the first Black woman to be a Federal judge—in the Southern District. Having diverse representation on the Court does not mean someone will rule a certain way, and it doesn’t mean that is why they deserve to be on the Bench. It is important because it strengthens our institutions. It is critical because it shows who we are as a nation, and it makes a difference to the girls and women across the country, who will now have a role model and know that they can aspire to do the same. That is why President Biden made that promise because he knew that it was beyond time to ensure the Su-preme Court has that representation; and it is clear that Judge Jackson will be a highly qualified Justice to fulfill that promise. Who we confirm to the Supreme Court matters. While the work of the Court may feel distant from our daily decisions and day-to-day lives, the Su-preme Court actually makes key deci-sions on whether individuals are pro-tected when they go to school, work, or out in public; on who can and how we can cast our votes to determine our elected officials; on whether our future generations will have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink; on who we can choose to marry; and on what decisions women can make about their own bodies and their reproductive fu-ture. The nine Justices on the Supreme Court make important decisions that impact all Americans; and in the Sen-ate, in our advice and consent role, we have a critical role to play in ensuring that we confirm Justices who follow the rule of law and provide equal jus-tice to all. The perspectives Judge Jackson will bring to the highest Court of the land, both personally and professionally, will have a critical impact on all Ameri-cans. Judge Jackson will bring to the Bench significant criminal defense ex-perience as a former public defender. She will also bring nearly a decade of judicial experience to her rulings. When I met Judge Jackson, I asked her which of her experiences have pre-pared her most for this moment to serve on the Supreme Court if she was confirmed. She answered by talking about her clerkships, which she com-pleted at each level of the judiciary: the district court; First Circuit Court of Appeals; and for Supreme Court Jus-tice Breyer, whose seat she is being nominated to fill. She talked about how she learned from others how to serve as a judge. She experienced first-hand what it means to fulfill the con-stitutional requirement of being a member of our Nation’s Federal judici-ary. I know that Judge Jackson will bring all of those perspectives and meaning-ful experiences with her to the Su-preme Court, and those are critically needed on the highest Court of our land. It is those experiences and her record that have led to Judge Jack-son’s nomination receiving broad sup-port—from the civil and human rights community to the law enforcement community and from colleagues in the judiciary nominated by Presidents of both parties, to name just a few. Given the fact that she was confirmed three times before this body with bipartisan support, the Senate should be able to once again confirm her with votes from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I look forward to enthusiastically casting my vote in support of Judge Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me and support her nomination as well. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to go into a little bit more detail about why I will not be voting for and in favor of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Now, as we have all heard and as we appreciate, there is no doubt that Judge Jackson is highly educated; she has an impressive resume; she is cor-dial; she was very gracious with her time, but as I listened to her responses over a 2-day period of time, I was really dissatisfied with the specifics. As I got home to Tennessee and talked to Tennesseans, they had want-ed to hear specifics from her and were disappointed that she did not come for-ward with those specifics. My colleague Senator DURBIN , helpfully, pointed out this morning that Judge Jackson did, indeed, make the rounds up here prior to her hearing. Yes, indeed, she did do that. She came to my office, and we spent about an hour together talking about her record. I, of course, didn’t give her a list of questions to study, but I did clue her in on some of the things that I thought were going to be important for us to discuss. Some are items we had discussed when she came before us for her appel-late court hearing. Some of those things we never got a complete answer to, but we needed to get that complete answer. This is a lifetime appointment, and it was disappointing that we did not, even now, get that complete an-swer. What I have learned is, normally—as we at Judiciary Committee conduct these hearings for judges for the Fed-eral bench, for Supreme Court nomi-nees—they walk into the hearing room, and they are prepared. They kind of come loaded with their remarks and their answers. They have a general idea of what is going to come their way from different ones of us because we have spent the time meeting with them individually, making certain that they know what is going to be important. So there is no doubt she knew that I was going to press her on her lack of a clear articulation on a judicial philos-ophy, and she knew that there were concerns and criticisms of her record and some of the decisions that she had made. She knew that we would ask tough constitutional law questions about abortion, substantive due proc-ess, and interstate commerce. And I know that I—and I think most of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee—would say that I expect nominees to be familiar with all of these things, to have an opinion and be willing to share that opinion. This is an appointment, as I said a moment ago, a lifetime appointment to the  highest Court in the land. This is not supposed to be an easy process. This is to be tough questions that are appro-priately placed. You know, tough ques-tions are not attacks. Tough questions are placed in search of answers—an-swers for the people we represent. But instead of showcasing what we were told was her extraordinary prowess for the law, Judge Jackson’s hearing turned into a showcase of things that she just did not want to talk about. My Democratic colleagues have spent a lot of time trying to provide cover for her, but the fact of the matter is that at the end of this week, the majority leader will ask us to green-light a Su-preme Court nominee who has not ar-ticulated a judicial philosophy, who filibustered her way through basic con-stitutional questions, and who repeat-edly pled ignorance of the most con-troversial items in her record. We have received Judge Jackson’s responses to our written questions, and unfortunately she still is refusing to open a window into her thinking. I asked her again about her ruling in Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, which focused, in part, on how a judge should interpret a statute that grants an agency ‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion’’ under the rules available. When Congress wrote those words, I am sure we believed that ‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion’’ meant exactly, precisely that this law was sole and unreviewable. But rather than focusing on the plain meaning of the text, Judge Jackson took it upon herself to evaluate and re-ject the DHS rule in question and es-tablish a nationwide injunction. Well, as we all know, fortunately, the DC Circuit overruled her. But the ques-tion remains: How in the world could any judge read those words and decide Congress wanted the opposite result of what Congress specifically said, ‘‘sole and unreviewable’’? But in a show of lack of respect for Congress and what Congress explicitly said because she disagreed with the policy, what did she do? She picked it up; she basically tore up that policy; and she did what she thought—what she thought—was best. In her written response, Judge Jackson offered no new information, but be-cause she tends to editorialize in her opinions, we can still glean some in-sight from what she had to say about the DHS case. She suggested that the Department of Homeland Security’s position was a ‘‘terrible proposal’’ that ‘‘reeks of bad faith’’ and ‘‘demonstrates contempt for the authority that the Constitution’s Framers have vested in the judicial branch.’’ Those are her words. I think that language might give us a hint as to why she ignored the statu-tory text. In Tennessee, Tennesseans look at that and say: Well, that is the work of an activist judge. They are try-ing to legislate from the bench. They didn’t like what Congress did, so they said: We are going to pick it up; we are going to toss it out; we are going to do what we think that policy ought to be. That was the effect of that ruling be-cause she ignored the statuary text. I have lingering questions about other times Judge Jackson has used this type of rhetoric to signal her pol-icy disagreements. Again, Tennesseans say that is judicial activism. During the height of the COVID–19 pandemic, she used a written judicial opinion to advocate for the mass re-lease of all 1,500 criminals in the cus-tody of the DC Department of Correc-tions. That is right, the release of all 1,561 detainees—all of them. During her hearing, she claimed she was merely repeating one of the attor-ney’s arguments, but we went back and we read the opinion. And when we read the opinion, it is very clear: That was not accurate. If you take her words at face value, you will get the impression that she believes a mass release—a mass release of detainees, of criminals—a mass re-lease is appropriate during the pan-demic. So if you look at our past pandemics and if you say, ‘‘Well, a pan-demic is going to come around; we are going to have something every 5 or 10 years,’’ I think it is reasonable to ques-tion her judgment on this. What hap-pens when you have the next Spanish flu or the next SARS? What happens the next time there is a pandemic? I think American citizens, I think Ten-nesseans want an answer on that. Why would someone think, ‘‘Open the doors and release them,’’ and then lament that they are not able to release all of them? I have questions about her record of being lenient with criminals. Over the course of her career, Judge Jackson has developed a disturbing habit of granting leniency to dangerous crimi-nals. She released a man who murdered a U.S. marshal and gave a reduced sen-tence to a criminal who was known for attacking police officers. She under-sentenced child porn offenders at every available opportunity—not once or twice but every time. If the guidelines gave her discretion, she used it to go easy on pedophiles. She looked for ways to go easy on dangerous drug offenders and, at one point, she actually apologized to a self- described fentanyl ‘‘kingpin’’ for his harsh sentence. That is of concern. It is of concern to many moms whose top issues right now are inflation, open borders, crime in the streets. They are worried about that. They are worried about what is happening. She had the opportunity to clear this up, but at no point did she offer a reas-suring explanation of why she so con-sistently used her discretion to tip the scales not in favor of victims but tip-ping those scales in favor of criminals. On this point, we are not questioning her methodology; we are questioning her judgment. When I was back home in Tennessee this weekend, everyone wanted to talk about Judge Jackson’s inability to de-fine the word ‘‘woman.’’ The media has spent a great deal of time mocking that question, and I will tell you, that is quite all right because out there in the real world, people care about how she chose to respond to that question. Their position is that if the media felt justified in mocking the very fact that I did ask that question, why did Judge Jackson have so much trouble answering that question? As my colleague Senator CRUZmentioned this morning, we have journalists today running around the Capitol, de-manding that Republican Senators an-swer the question. Why aren’t they asking the same of Judge Jackson? Every day, Tennesseans are subjected to this assault on common sense, and they are not interested in playing along with this. Why, they want to know, is the left so terrified to con-front how the American people define the word ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘womanhood’’? And why would my Democratic col-leagues continue to prop up a nominee who squandered her hearing by dodging questions and claiming ignorance of her very own record? Tennesseans aren’t interested in playing politics. They just want the Democrats to reveal what rule book they are using because Tennesseans want to see constitutionalist judges on the bench. They want people to call balls and strikes. They want people who believe in equal treatment under the law, equal justice for all. They see what is happening in our country. It is frightening to them. For a long time now, radical activists have wanted to handpick a Supreme Court Justice. Some of these dark money groups that are all there helping the left, they said: Give us your money. We will make certain there are Federal judges and a Supreme Court Justice who are progressive. In the meantime, we have seen them make inroads in the media, on school boards, and in some of the country’s most respected universities. So Tennesseans are very familiar with what happens when activism be-gins to replace common sense. They are very familiar with the tactics of the left that continue to try to dimin-ish freedoms of individuals and give that power to the government. That is why they want constitutionalists on the Court, not activist judges who are there to take up arms in the culture war. They don’t want an agenda. They don’t want to hear about a method-ology. They want proof that Judge Jackson has a vision for America that is rooted in the Constitution. They want to have proof that this is some-body who believes in preserving our faith, our families, our freedoms, pre-serving hope and opportunity for all. They want somebody who is going to say: I believe in the American dream, and I am going to preserve the right for every girl and boy to live their version of the American dream.  Unfortunately, just like the President who nominated her, Judge Jack-son has provided no evidence of that vi-sion. I am a ‘‘no’’ vote on her confirma-tion. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. SMITH). The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I have already announced that I intend to support Judge Jackson’s nomina-tion. Her character and her qualifica-tions are unassailable, but, unfortu-nately, that hasn’t stopped a number of Senate Republicans from treating her disgracefully. Too often, behavior in the hearings was simply shameful. It doesn’t have to be this way, and it wasn’t always this way. For example, even though I disagreed with him on plenty of issues, I voted for Chief Jus-tice John Roberts, and he was treated very fairly by Democrats. Serious ques-tions were asked and answered, and there wasn’t anything resembling the over-the-line, juvenile theatrics like those shown for Judge Jackson. Things changed when President Obama’s final nomination was stolen by Republicans. They refused to even hold a hearing or consider the sitting President’s nominee on just fabricated grounds. Democrats are trying to maintain a sharp focus on legal questions and per-sonal qualifications. Faced with sideshows and personal attacks, we stuck to issues. What was particularly striking about those attacks was they were attacks against somebody whom Senate Republicans had voted for unanimously when she was nominated to a lower level court. My view is, the radicalization of the Court and the nominations process are just poisonous to our democracy, but that was what was on display when Re-publicans attacked Judge Jackson. I want to start setting the record straight on several of the key issues. First, Judge Jackson is squarely within the sentencing norm for cases involving child sexual abuse material. She was smeared anyway as going soft on predators. It was a gross and base-less accusation, more of a dog whistle to conspiracists than an attempt at honestly vetting a nominee. Even the National Review—nobody’s idea of a liberal publication—published a col-umn that called the comments of our colleague from Missouri, Senator HAWLEY —it called his attack ‘‘meritless to the point of dema-goguery.’’ Those were the words of the National Review. The fact is, on this hugely important issue, the whole question of kids’ safe-ty, as the Presiding Officer of the Sen-ate knows, there is a big difference be-tween talking about protecting child victims and actually doing the work. Far too many of our Republican col-leagues just come down on the wrong side of the divide. It is absolutely right that government at every level has failed to pro-tect kids from exploitation online. That failure has a lot of causes. One is that the Justice Department, for rea-sons I will never understand, has con-sistently declined to put enough man-power and funding behind protecting these vulnerable kids. Another reason is that Members of Congress talk a really big game, but when there is seri-ous legislation to protect vulnerable kids, they disappear. Now, I have proposed an alternative. It is the Invest in Child Safety Act. It puts serious funds into tracking down the child predators and prosecuting these god-awful monsters and pro-tecting the kids they target and abuse. It would create a new executive posi-tion, to be confirmed by the Senate, to raise this level of protecting kids and strengthen oversight. Now, instead of supporting that legislation, where we put real prosecutors and real investigators to the task of protecting our kids, putting more law enforcement on the beat, a number of Senate Republicans spend their days going after section 230 of the Commu-nications Decency Act. So, yet again, vulnerable kids are being used as pawns by politicians to advance their agenda. I simply believe that child abuse and exploitation is too serious an issue for U.S. Senators to cheapen it with base-less accusations and ill-conceived legis-lation. This is the last subject—pro-tecting our kids—that elected officials ought to be playing politics with. WOMEN ’S HEALTHCARE  Madam President, I am going to use the remainder of my time to discuss another issue that came up often in the debate, and that is the right of Amer-ican women to control their bodies. I am talking here about Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court has effectively overturned Roe already when you look, for example, at the various States. The Court has overturned Roe for millions and millions of people. They did it on the shadow docket by allowing an obvi-ously unconstitutional bounty law in Texas to go into effect. Now States all over the country are passing similar laws, and in some States, they are going even further to restrict the fun-damental right of women to control their own bodies. The fact of the matter is, this debate is not just about Roe. It is becoming commonplace for Republicans to say out in the open that the Supreme Court ruled incorrectly in Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 case that af-firmed the right of married people to use contraception. That is what this debate has become all about—not just the right to a safe and legal abortion; it is about rolling back the right to birth control. Republicans are saying that the case that affirmed the right to use birth control was wrongly decided. That is what our colleague from Tennessee who just spoke said ahead of the hear-ings on Judge Jackson’s nomination. It is enough to leave you wondering: What year is this? What century is this? Connecticut’s ban on contraception was based on a Federal law from the 1870s, a law from a time when women’s rights were few. They couldn’t even vote. For Connecticut to have that kind of law on the books in 1965 was a ridicu-lous infringement on the liberty and body autonomy of American women. Estelle Griswold, the women’s rights activist whose name is atop the case, once half-joked that the State would have to ‘‘put a gynecological table at the Greenwich toll station’’ to prevent women from going to New York to get the contraception they needed. But the history in Connecticut shows, as is often the case, this old re-striction on personal liberty fell hard-est on women without means, even when the law was badly out of date. The Supreme Court ruled correctly when it struck down Connecticut’s law in 1965. To say otherwise is appalling and alarming. The Court recognized that the government ought to stay out of people’s private decisions about fam-ily planning. A few years later, the court correctly applied the Griswold precedent to single women. A year after that came Roe. These cases are linked. Put together, the attacks on Roe, and now Griswold, they are about letting the government control when somebody decides to start a family. We are talking about rolling back 80 years of basic human rights. Prior to her appointment on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in these debates over Roe: Also in the balance is a woman’s autonomous charge of her life’s full course . . . her ability to stand in relation to man, society, and the state as an independent, self-sus-taining equal citizen. When the Court upheld Roe in 1992, the majority ruled that ‘‘[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.’’ If women can’t legally obtain birth control and they can’t legally obtain abortion care, they no longer have legal control over their bodies. Let’s be clear. If women do not control their own bodies, they don’t control their own lives. And if Americans don’t control their own lives, they are not free and equal under the law. Tossing out Roe—the way this Court has—is an act of judicial radicalism. Every Republican Supreme Court nominee swears up and down that they respect precedent; they won’t legislate from the bench. Then they go out and toss out Roe on the shadow docket. For Republicans now to be going after Griswold is staggering and dan-gerous. For Senators to be attacking this ruling 57 years after the case was decided is ridiculous. This is not just because birth control is part of basic health regimens. It is because women in America have an equal right to chart the course of their lives and when to become pregnant.  Now, Republicans often talk about their position in the context of States’ rights. Too often, what they are saying is they believe in States’ rights only if they believe the State is right, and we see that on issue after issue. And, finally, it is important to consider these debates in the context of what is happening in statehouses around the country. Republican legis-latures are effectively banning abor-tion. They are passing laws that do more to protect rapists than rape vic-tims. They criminalize abortion care, and in other cases they are criminal-izing the act of helping women obtain the healthcare they need. Some States want to make it impossible to use these kinds of medicines and therapies to safely end pregnancies early. A Republican lawmaker in Mis-souri recently proposed forcing women to carry ectopic pregnancies to term, which is effectively a death sentence. The bottom line is, what is happening today, in 2022, is collectively the most extreme attack on reproduc-tive health, freedom, and equality in America I can remember. And I am just going to close by saying this is not the same debate as we have had over Roe. State-level Repub-licans are going way beyond that point. For Republicans here in this Congress to be going after Griswold—after birth control—is a shocking escalation in the fight they are making to roll back the rights of women. American lives and liberty are at stake. Americans need to be prepared to fight for freedom and equality in the months and years ahead. I am sure going to be out there with them. In the meantime, I believe Judge Jackson is going to make an out-standing Supreme Court Justice and a bulwark for the rights of women and all Americans. This is a historic confirmation, one that is long overdue. I am proud to give Judge Jackson my vote, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination as well. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —S. 3959 Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I am here today to discuss what I saw this past weekend when I took a trip to our southern border in Texas. I led a delegation of eight sheriffs and mayors from my home State of Tennessee. We went to see what is hap-pening, what the effects of the border crisis are, and to hear from them and allow the border agents to hear from them the effects of the border crisis in our own communities in Tennessee. Our mayors and sheriffs are seeing record drug overdoses, gang violence, and other forms of criminal activity right there in Tennessee. We learned that what is really happening at our border is quite simple: Well-financed, operationally sophisti-cated drug cartels, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, are exploit-ing our immigration policies and human economic desires to make bil-lions of dollars from drug and human trafficking. Ignored by the Biden administration and the corporate media, this increas-ingly powerful criminal enterprise is expanding further into American com-munities. Our trip revealed two key insights. First, under Biden policies, this na-tional security crisis is unmanageable. Second, and paradoxically, this crisis is well within the Federal Government’s ability to fix. My central takeaway was this: If every American saw what we saw and heard, this would end. America wouldn’t tolerate this. It is a crisis. Here is the cartels’ business model: Fentanyl ingredients are shipped from China to Mexico. In Mexico, the cartels turn these chemicals into astonish-ingly potent drugs bound for the United States. Last year, fentanyl seized at the border was more than enough to kill every American. And that is just what we caught. Think about what has not been caught. Think about what is getting through. The cartels control the entire Mexican side of the U.S. border, and each migrant must pay thousands of dollars for safe passage to these cartels. Often, they have to pay through subsequent indentured servitude. Many young women become victims of human traf-ficking. So in this vicious cycle, the more illegal immigration, the more money for the cartels; and the more money for the cartels, the more drugs they produce. For cartels, the illegal immigrants are more than an expendable revenue source. They are a tool for facilitating transport of drugs and criminals. The cartels push scores of migrant cus-tomers across the border so they can occupy American border agents. Then they exploit the resulting gaps in pa-trol coverage to move across drugs, gang members, those they refer to as ‘‘high-value’’ individuals, terrorist- watch-list members, and others. Border Patrol agents told me that, given the recordbreaking border cross-ings they are currently facing, there are times when every agent is busy processing migrant paperwork, leaving the border wide open for drug and human trafficking. The drugs and gang members and the accompanying vio-lence will then flood into our American communities. As one agent put it: The people crossing the border don’t stay in this area, and neither do the drugs. More than 100,000 Americans died last year from drug overdoses, mostly from fentanyl, which are really more akin to CCP-engineered poisonings. Several thousands were Tennesseans. The Ten-nessee sheriffs and mayors on this trip told me that deaths from illicit drug overdoses in their counties are at record highs. Our Tennessee sheriffs know the families in their communities. They told me the toughest part of their job is to see a mother or a grandmother, to go to their home and tell them that their son or their grand-son will never return. It is heart-breaking. Each one of these obituaries has the CCP’s fingerprint on it. The migrants’ money and usefulness to distract border agents are essential to the cartels’ operations. These illegal immigrants are incentivized to come because of our current catch-and-re-lease policies. To illustrate the current policy of absurdity, last Friday, around midnight, near a stretch of—of course—unfin-ished border wall, right outside of McAllen, TX, our vehicle came across about 15 recently arrived migrants. They approached us and asked us where they could find the Border Pa-trol agents. They wanted to turn them-selves in, having been coached by their cartel handlers that this was the first step to U.S. Government-funded release into America. Our policies are so up-side-down that the suspects are looking for the officers. Nevertheless, U.S. Border Patrol and other law enforcement Agencies are working tirelessly day and night to protect our Nation. Understandably, morale is at an all-time low with a Biden administration that refuses to give them the tools that they need to deal with this crisis. Border Patrol can process a maximum of roughly 5,000 migrants a day. Right now, they are facing nearly 8,000 migrants a day. And when the Biden administration lifts title 42 authority, they fear that the number could exceed 15,000 per day. Therefore, and unsurprisingly, the constant plea I heard from Border Pa-trol agents was this: We need effective policy, not more agents, not more equipment. Bad policies are what have created this incentive to cross the bor-der, and eliminating these policies is the only fix. Our agents signed up to protect our border, not to facilitate its demise. Border agents in Laredo told me that the Migrant Protection Protocols, known as MPP, were a perfect illustra-tion of the need for policy change. MPP was a policy that required migrants seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico until it was deter-mined whether or not they were actu-ally entitled to asylum. Most are not. When it was implemented in 2019, the agent said it was like flipping a switch because this stopped people coming when they knew that they wouldn’t get in. This ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy cut illegal border crossings dramatically in fiscal year 2020. Yet the Biden adminis-tration nixed the MPP, and, not sur-prisingly, border crossings more than quadrupled in fiscal year 2021. With the help of their media allies, Washington Democrats ignore this cri-sis and they hope that the American people will too. They don’t travel to  the border because they don’t want to answer for the crisis that they have created. They have chosen appease-ment of loud, radical immigration groups over American security, over American sovereignty. President Biden and Vice President KAMALA HARRIS haven’t seen the border stations where the agents sacrifice day and night, mentally and phys-ically, battling a crisis that their De-partments haven’t given them the tools to address. For many Americans, this crisis seems far away, at least until it is too late—until it is their child, their grandchild, their brother and sister who become a statistic. That is the other thing that I heard constantly from Border Patrol and law enforcement agents: We need someone to tell America what is happening here. With the President and media averting their eyes and abdicating their re-sponsibilities, it becomes even more critical to spread the word before more American lives are needlessly lost, be-fore more migrants’ lives are destroyed in the journey or through indentured servitude once they arrive, and more communities are damaged beyond re-pair. So what can we do to address this crisis? Even though the border cries is worse than ever, the Biden administration is voluntarily ending title 42 pandemic- related authority for expedited re-moval. The Border Patrol agents I met this weekend believe that this will make this recordbreaking crisis substantially worse. Such a surrender of American security would be intolerable. And there is another health crisis that title 42 is critical to battling. The cartels send migrants across at stra-tegic points to bog down Border Patrol agents with paperwork processing that takes five times longer without title 42. Then they use the resulting enforce-ment gaps to move fentanyl across the border. We have to close these enforcement gaps with better policy. So I have introduced legislation to add drug smuggling as an additional basis for title 42 authority. Overdoses have become an epidemic in America. This legislation would allow the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services to use title 42 to combat drug traf-ficking across the border. This bill would give our Border Patrol agents the tools they need to quickly remove migrants who illegally cross the bor-der, substantially freeing up agents to focus on actually stopping drug traf-fickers. More than 100,000 Americans died last year from drug overdoses, many from fentanyl coming from across our south-ern border. We desperately need title 42 to fight this drug epidemic. It is a tool that would quite literally save Amer-ican lives in every State in the Union immediately. So, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Com-mittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from fur-ther consideration of S. 3959 and the Senate proceed to its immediate con-sideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object. This is not the right way to get at the fentanyl problem. This gives the Secretary permission to shut down all asylum seekers from a country on the basis of any type of drug, no matter how much is in possession, how fre-quently that drug is possessed, what country they are coming from. We are calling for essentially a complete shut-down of the asylum program because there might be fentanyl somewhere. But it also gives the Secretary author-ity to stop asylum seekers coming from any country for any drug at any scale. Now, title 42 authority is a serious thing. It is a blanket authority to block anyone presenting themselves for asylum. We have seen the horrific im-ages in Ukraine. We know between 4 and 5 million people are already refu-gees, and we know that the United States, as the indispensable Nation, wants to take a leadership role in ac-commodating these refugees in Europe and, if necessary, in the United States. People presenting themselves for asylum, escaping their dangerous home country—that is actually part of the American dream. That is, in a lot of ways, how many of us arrived, right? There may not have been this statu-tory framework, but the principle in-volved was not just that you came from some other place far away to make a better life for yourself—some-times it was that, but sometimes it was to escape the pogrom, as was the case with my grandparents, from Kyiv to Odesa, actually to Canada, and then to Hawaii. And so this authority is no small thing. And to give the Secretary of HHS this blanket authority to essen-tially shut down all asylum seekers be-cause we are afraid—appropriately afraid—of a specific drug is just a little ham-fisted. And I appreciate the Senator’s remarks. I think there are better ways to work on this, and therefore I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from Ha-waii for his remarks, but I want to ex-plain what just happened here. My colleague objects, despite the fact that recordbreaking numbers of Ameri-cans are currently dying from overdoses, fueled by fentanyl coming across our border. This legislation is a tool to help save American lives. In-deed, 100,000 American lives were lost last year to drug overdoses. These lives are being deprived of the American dream forever. So Democrats are cat-egorically opposed to commonsense border security tools to prevent drug trafficking into America no matter how bad the drug overdose numbers get? How much longer will it take to change course from the Biden adminis-tration policies that have created this national security crisis? How much longer will we allow our immigration system to be manipulated by a massive transnational criminal alliance be-tween the Chinese communists and bil-lion-dollar cartels who are shipping deadly quantities of illicit drugs into the United States? I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. LEE. Madam President, today, I rise to share my concerns with the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate Jus-tice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Let me begin my remarks by noting that I have enjoyed getting to know Judge Jackson. My visits with her and conversations with her in the com-mittee and otherwise and also my interaction with Judge Jackson’s fam-ily have all reinforced what I know of her generally, which is that she is a good person, a noble citizen, and some-one who has earned very impressive academic and professional credentials. After graduating from Harvard Law School, she ended up clerking at all three levels of the Federal judiciary and worked at a number of positions over the years as a lawyer. She has now, as a judge, served as a Federal district judge, which is a trial court po-sition, and has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, which is an appellate court position. If con-firmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, she will have served at all three levels of the Federal judiciary, which is itself an impressive accomplishment and one that I think would benefit the Supreme Court. Any time they have the insight of someone who has served in that many roles, it can be helpful. She is a good person in many respects and comes with impressive qualifications academically and profes-sionally, but I do have concerns, and those concerns are what I want to turn to now. Many of them date back to efforts by groups like Demand Justice to shame and intimidate Judge Jackson’s former boss and the Justice whom she would be replacing if confirmed to this posi-tion, Justice Breyer, into retiring by paying for a billboard mounted on a truck to drive around the Supreme Court of the United States, bearing the slogan ‘‘Retire, Breyer.’’ These same groups are now the same groups that are spending money—millions of dol-lars—to advocate for Judge Jackson’s speedy confirmation. Then there was the shameless leaking of Justice  April 6, 2022 Breyer’s decision to retire well before he was ready to announce it. Now we find ourselves in the midst of a needlessly rushed nomination proc-ess, where liberal dark money groups are pressuring Senate Democrats to confirm their preferred Supreme Court nominee months—many months—in advance of when she could actually be seated on the Court. Because of this false sense of urgency being presented by the radical left, we have also seen the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee refuse to accommodate reasonable and common-sense document requests from Repub-lican members of that committee. The same members of the committee who demanded more time to review and in-terrogate a nominee about his high school yearbook are now feigning out-rage and insisting that it is somehow unacceptable that we should demand more time to review a nominee’s own judicial record. The contrast is signifi-cant. Let me provide some additional context to illustrate how outrageous that aspect of this situation is. My Republican colleagues and I have been very keen to hear from Judge Jackson about her judicial philosophy. This is something that is an essential part of assessing any judicial nomi-nee’s fitness for office. The higher level the nomination, the more important it is to understand that. Nowhere is this more important than when the nomi-nee is someone who has been nomi-nated to serve on the highest Court in the land, the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Jackson, significantly, has refused to describe her judicial philos-ophy or even to agree that she has one. Instead, she has told us that she has a methodology, but this methodology— neutrally applying the law to all rel-evant facts—is nothing more than a simple statement—a simple rote reci-tation—of what judges do, not an ex-planation of how they do it. When Republicans on the Judiciary Committee pressed Judge Jackson for more information about her judicial philosophy or any statement about it, Chairman DURBIN and the nominee both directed us to her judicial record. So we asked Judge Jackson about her record. We inquired about questionable sentences in child pornography cases, sentences that appeared to constitute a pattern and practice of giving inexplicably light sentences to crimi-nals—people who are caught traf-ficking in what can only be described as the products of the commercializa-tion of child sex torture. These are vile offenses. Her response was that we sim-ply couldn’t understand her sentencing decisions. We couldn’t understand them just by looking only at the public record because we didn’t see what she saw. We didn’t have the information that she had. Now, Chairman DURBIN told us that we can discern Judge Jackson’s judi-cial philosophy from her judicial record. Judge Jackson told us that we can’t understand her judicial record without all of the supporting docu-ments that informed her decisions. So we asked for those supporting docu-ments, which included presentence re-ports from those cases involving child pornography possession. Chairman DURBIN ’s response? Not on my watch— his words, not mine. Democrats dis-missed our requests as baseless attacks on Judge Jackson herself. What if we said, ‘‘That isn’t true’’? Do they contest that Judge Jackson presided over those cases? That she, in fact, imposed those sentences? Do they contest that she imposed those sen-tences or that Judge Jackson’s sen-tences departed from both the sen-tencing guideline ranges and from the requests of the prosecutors? These are simply the facts in the record, and we have questions about them, legitimate questions. So, if this is a baseless attack to a nominee’s factual record, what exactly is the purpose and scope of the Senate’s duty to offer our advice and consent with regard to such nominations? After we pushed back, Chairman DURBIN based his continued refusal on the sensitive nature of the documents at issue. Now, I agree completely that presentence reports are highly sen-sitive. They contain sensitive informa-tion in them, and this body of written work product deals with necessarily sensitive materials on a regular basis. The U.S. Senate deals with sensitive records, so the fact that these are sen-sitive documents doesn’t mean that we can’t handle them. In fact, we already have security measures in place to pro-tect that kind of information. We even have specified rooms where we can and routinely do review sensitive informa-tion. So hiding behind a glib quote about protecting children at the ex-pense of thousands upon thousands of actual child victims is shameful. The chairman says that parents are living in fear that presentence reports that discuss harm to their children would be confidentially shared with this body for the limited purpose of al-lowing us to do our job, to review Judge Jackson’s record. I think it is more likely—far more likely, in fact— that parents of sexually exploited chil-dren live in fear that their children may be victimized again when one of Judge Jackson’s defendants gets re-leased from prison after an unconscion-ably, indefensibly short sentence. To make matters even worse, not only have Democrats refused Repub-lican requests for more information on Judge Jackson’s judicial record, but they have withheld information from me and my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I am refer-ring in this context to a chart ref-erenced accidentally by a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee that summarized probation office sen-tencing recommendations gleaned from the presentence reports—the same presentence reports that we have re-quested and that we have not been allowed to see. Now, I have to admit I am still unclear as to how the majority obtained this information. Chairman DURBIN  wrote to Republicans that the chart was given to him by the White House, which, in turn, obtained the chart from Judge Jackson’s chambers. However, when I and every other Republican member on the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee wrote to Judge Jackson to re-quest further information, she replied that she had no way of obtaining the requested information because it ‘‘is the property of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and I am no longer a member of that court.’’ How, then, did her chambers obtain the information that was provided to the White House and then provided to Sen-ate Democrats which came from the presentence reports? Do the Democrats have something to hide—something that they can avoid having to reveal and have discussed by rushing Judge Jackson’s nomination? What might it be? It may be the one thing Judge Jackson steadfastly refused to share—her judicial philosophy. Despite my Democratic colleagues’ pretending that judicial philosophy is some arcane and esoteric legal concept that doesn’t matter, Americans every-where instinctively understand its im-portance. While they may not all use the same terminology, Americans know that justice—as we imagine Lady Justice always depicted as being blind or blindfolded—is to ensure equal jus-tice under the law for everyone regard-less of their race, their religion, their background, their creed. That kind of justice matters to every petitioner, every respondent, every plaintiff, and every defendant who comes before our courts. That kind of justice can be en-sured only by judges adhering to a guiding principle by which they bring clarity out of often unclear language. The Supreme Court is not a representative body; Congress is. Justices are not accountable to the people once they are confirmed, but we are. That is why we have heard from virtually every nominee that their personal per-spectives on X, Y, and Z don’t matter— because they are fully committed to applying the law without their own personal perspectives getting in the way. That is exactly right and could not more fully demonstrated the im-portance of judicial philosophy. When a Justice is swayed by her natural incli-nations or fails to get to a neutral place when deciding a particular case, adherence to her judicial philosophy keeps her from violating that commit-ment. That guiding principle con-stitute a judge’s judicial philosophy. Now, look, judicial philosophy is not a methodology or, as I said earlier when Judge Jackson described her judi-cial methodology as simply applying the law to the facts, that is not de-scribing her unique approach to judi-cial decision making. She was simply reciting the definition of what a judge does.  Every judge applies the law to the facts. That is literally what it means to be a judge. The question is, How? Because statutory and constitutional language is often unclear, whether on its face or as applied in a particular context. What matters is how a judge resolves that ambiguity. Laws are not self-interpreting, and interpretation is rarely obvious, especially in the dif-ficult cases that tend uniquely to come before the Supreme Court of the United States on the merits. You have to have a guiding principle by which to bring clarity out of unclear language. That is your judicial philosophy. So a judge without a judicial philosophy is no more useful than a pastor without a theology. It is just someone making it up as they go along, dressing up their opinions as holy writ. A nomi-nee who claims to have no judicial phi-losophy is either being misleading or is perhaps unsuited to a lifetime appoint-ment on the Federal bench, let alone on the highest Court in the land. Yet the vast majority of President Biden’s judicial nominees have repeatedly as-serted that they simply don’t have one; that they lack a judicial philosophy. This sudden and uniform shift suddenly and strongly suggests that they are being coached to give precisely that in-explicable, indefensible answer. And yet every judge does, in fact, have a judicial philosophy. Whether they acknowledge it or not, whether it is easily definable by a few words or a few sentences, they do have one. When a nominee refuses to describe her judi-cial philosophy, the likely explanation is simply that she does have one; she just knows that neither the public nor this body would approve of it. In that case, we are left to infer what her judi-cial philosophy is from her record, which is precisely what Chairman DURBINand Judge Jackson suggested that we do. Except, as I have already point-ed out, they don’t want us to have the whole record, and they are unreason-ably denying our access to the whole record. So, again, Judge Jackson refuses to tell us what her judicial philosophy is. Senator DURBIN says we can find it in her record; Judge Jackson says we can’t fully understand her record with-out all the supporting documents, but neither of them will let us see these documents. If this makes you nervous, that is because it should. So why does this matter? Well, we got to see this firsthand 2 weeks ago. While Judge Jackson insisted that she didn’t have a judicial philosophy, she actually did give us a small peek into it. In response to a question from Sen-ator DURBIN about the sentencing guidelines and child pornography of-fenders, she acknowledged Congress implemented a statutory scheme with specific directives to courts to help them determine how they are to sen-tence defendants found guilty of pos-sessing or distributing child sexual as-sault material. But then she admitted that she and other judges have made a habit of using the discretion they are given in applying the sentencing guide-lines that disregard or discount the parts that, in their view, no longer make sense, saying: Courts are adjusting their sentences in order to account for the changed cir-cumstances. With all due respect, that is not her or any other judge’s decision to make. Courts don’t change the law; Congress changes the law. If Congress one day decides that receiving child sexual as-sault material electronically is some-how less offensive than receiving it through the mail, then we will change the law. Judge Jackson insists that she was statutorily required to consider the factors—the very factors she relied upon—to depart from the guidelines, consistently sentencing defendants to prison terms considerably below where the sentencing guidelines would have sent her. All that is true, but all the factors listed in the statute in question, codi-fied in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553, Judge Jackson seems to weigh quite heavily those factors that will decrease an of-fender’s sentence and gives, appar-ently, short shrift to those who would lengthen the sentence in these child pornography cases. This kind of cherry-picking of considerations resulted in astonishing out-comes, like giving one defendant 3 months in prison instead of 10 years. Her willingness to change the outcome based not on the law but based on her own sense of ‘‘changed circumstances’’ demonstrates a lack of judicial humil-ity and restraint, and that is troubling. Unfortunately, this lack of judicial humility and restraint was not limited to any narrow line of cases. It wasn’t limited to those cases that involved the production and distribution and possession of child pornography. In the case of Make the Road New York v. McAleenan, Judge Jackson ig-nored clear statutory language, stating that she didn’t even have jurisdiction to review the case. She set aside that language and instead reached back in time to apply the previously enacted and much broader Administrative Pro-cedures Act to obtain her preferred outcome, the outcome advocated for by the dark money group Arabella Advi-sors, which happens to be funding the campaign for her confirmation. When asked about this case, Judge Jackson doubled down on her faulty reasoning, even though it had been overturned by the left-leaning DC Circuit. Unfortunately, this was not the only case where Judge Jackson ignored clear statutory language to assert ju-risdiction and reach her preferred pol-icy outcome. To make matters worse, Judge Jackson took multiple opportunities in her responses to my colleagues’ written questions to separate herself from prin-ciples that form the bedrock of our constitutional Republic. When asked by Senator CRUZif she believed that individuals possess nat-ural rights, she said: I do not hold a position on whether individuals possess natural rights. This is after she acknowledged that these lines from our Declaration of Independence reflect natural rights: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. When asked by Senator C ORNYN if she believed that natural law is reflected in the Bill of Rights, she stated that she ‘‘would interpret the Bill of Rights based on the methods of constitutional interpretation the Supreme Court em-ploys, not based on principles derived from natural law.’’ These responses eliminate any hope that I had that even if Judge Jackson interprets and applies statutes incor-rectly, she would still be guided by our Founding documents. Every part of Judge Jackson’s record—that is, every part that we have been given—seems to indicate something of a desire to sepa-rate herself from grounding principles in order to reach her desired outcomes. This is why judicial philosophy matters. This is why it isn’t just some eso-teric exercise for law nerds. This is why it matters and should matter to every American. When a judge can impose her own policy views in contradiction of the ex-pressed will of the people through their elected representatives in Congress, it doesn’t just undermine our representa-tive system of government. As we have seen here, it can put child predators back on the streets. In one case, the convict, upon release from his inexplicably short jail sen-tence, resumed seeking out suggestive images of children to the point that Judge Jackson had to agree to send him to 6 months in a halfway house. In another case, the convict who had been convicted of raping his 13-year-old niece and then falsifying his address to evade the sex offender registry, sexu-ally assaulted another family member after being released from the light sen-tence imposed previously by Judge Jackson. Neither of these defendants would have had these opportunities to re-offend had Judge Jackson just followed the sentencing guidelines and what the law required. Judicial philosophy matters. It is foundational to the very fabric of our constitutional Republic. And, again, there are no magic words we are look-ing for. There is not a single judicial philosophy that is either going to deem it acceptable or not acceptable, but they need to have one. They need to be willing to talk about it and explain what animates, what motivates their decision making, how they will go about construing these statutes. If judges won’t commit to giving effect to the words of the laws that Con-gress passes, as understood at the time  they were written and enacted, then American voters have no control over the laws that govern them. We will be ruled in that kind of scenario by a self- anointed class of five philosopher Kings in black robes. I fear Judge Jackson may see the Court in that very way. I fear that based on her answer to a question in the hearing raised by one of my col-leagues. In response to that question, she said: Well, anytime the Supreme Court have five votes . . . they have a majority for whatever opinion they determine. The Constitution demands more, and the American people deserve better. For all these reasons, I oppose Judge Jackson’s nomination. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. OSSOFF ). The Senator from Delaware. CORONAVIRUS  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we are in the middle of a horrible global pan-demic. Later this month, we will pass a tragic milestone of a million Ameri-cans killed by COVID–19. Already, more than 6 million globally have died. And I know we are all sick and tired of it, completely tired of it, done with it. I hear all the time at home and here that we are done with this pandemic, but, unfortunately, it is not done with us. This week, this body has failed to take minimally responsible action. And I am going to speak for a few min-utes to what it means that we have failed to come together to pass another urgently needed appropriations bill both to meet our domestic needs for therapeutics and vaccines and for treatment and for the development of the next vaccine for the next variant and what it means that we have deliv-ered zero additional resources for glob-al public health to address this worst global pandemic in a century. The bill that we should be taking up now and is being blocked by disagree-ments would have provided $10 billion to help provide additional protection for 330 million Americans, to buy the therapeutics that we need, to invest in the research to make sure that we are ready for the next variant, to finish providing the public health support for vaccinations. While we may think we are done with the virus, 30,000 Americans yesterday tested positive. It has touched all of our communities, our families, my own family, our own neighborhoods. We are not done with this. Senator SCHUMER and others of my colleagues have been saying on this floor and in public and in private re-lentlessly, we must deliver more re-sources. Well, I am here to say that we cannot get this pandemic under control here in the United States and secure the safety and health of our people until we have delivered meaningful vaccine protection around the world. It is shortsighted for us to say that because we are done with it, it is done with us. I will remind you, we have twice before gone through periods where things were looking better, things were looking up, and then the Delta variant emerged, the Omicron variant emerged in other places in the world where vaccination rates were not what we might hope for, not what we have achieved here and in other coun-tries. So let me briefly explain why this is a case of ‘‘pay me now or pay me later.’’ I understand the fiscal concerns that have driven some to say we should spend no more, but I think we will dis-cover the foolishness of a view that says we need not spend more. First, it is just a waste of money, folks. We have already bought hun-dreds of millions of vaccine doses that are now not going to be delivered in countries in the world, and particu-larly in Africa, where the public health systems are not developed enough to actually translate vaccine doses into vaccinations. As I learned during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia, that last mile from the capital to the regions to villages is really hard to navigate. It is hard to navigate here in the United States, heck. But in countries without cold storage chains, without rural public health resources, without the resources to pay for people to go and vaccinate, not having that last dollar to go that last mile means that we are letting people die when we have got the vac-cines to save their lives; and it means we continue to have 2.8 billion unvaccinated people around the world. Second, this is a moment where we can teach the world, again, that the United States, long the most reliable global public health partner, can be counted on in this critical moment. Dozens of countries could not get our vaccines 6 months or a year ago, so they have relied on Chinese and Rus-sian vaccines that are ineffective against Omicron. A variant emerged able to get around Sinopharm and Sputnik, the vaccines delivered by the Chinese and Russians. So we have a moment when dozens of countries around the world are asking for our help. We have got the vaccines; we have got the opportunity; and we are failing to take advantage of this moment. The most compelling reason, of course, is our own people’s health. We have seen this cycle before, and we will see this cycle again. How bad is the vaccination status in other places around the world? Well, briefly: Yemen, a country undergoing a horrific war with widespread famine, their vaccination rate is less than 1.5 percent. In Haiti, in our hemisphere, a nation of 11 million people, their vac-cination rate is below 1 percent. The number of folks fully vaccinated in two great countries on the continent of Af-rica—Tanzania, 60 million people; Nige-ria, 200 million people—below 5 per-cent. We cannot afford to allow this virus, COVID–19, which is like a safecracker, out there in the world to just keep twisting the dials and testing, testing, testing—because every time it infects someone, it has a chance to mutate. Every time it mutates, it has a chance to get past our defenses. We will regret this failure. We need to treat this like the global health emergency it is, and we need to realize that we already had hundreds of mil-lions of people facing food insecurity before the Russian invasion of Ukraine accelerated the vulnerability of mil-lions of people around the world be-cause Ukraine is the breadbasket from which is fed countries all over the re-gion: the Middle East and North Africa, from Syria to Somalia. We are going to see food riots, increased instability, and millions more in hunger. So, folks, I will keep at this. I will keep working. I will keep mobilizing and engaging my colleagues, both Democratic and Republican, in making the case until it is done; but we have a moral imperative, an economic impera-tive, a political imperative, a humani-tarian imperative to save our own country and our own people by pro-viding the resources the world needs and deserves. We have so many good partners in this—organizations like One, USGOC, Care, Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, Bread for the World, and many others—too many to name. But we need the same level of energy and commitment and engagement in this Chamber that we have heard from calls from around our country and our world. The world is looking to the United States to use the vaccines we have, use the resources we have, pro-vide the support to get us on the other side of this pandemic globally. Mr. President, this is the moment that we should do it. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to a great accomplishment that will occur in this Senate later this week: the confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have lived through—I have endured—several confirmation proc-esses. I will say, this is one that brings me some joy, a sense of lift that we are making history for this Chamber and for the Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, who has announced his intention to retire, is someone who has spent decades on the Federal bench, on the Supreme Court, and has lived up to the highest ideals of Amer-ican jurisprudence; and I am confident Judge Jackson, as Justice Jackson, will continue in that tradition. She has, as we learned in our week of con-firmation hearings, a deep under-standing of the Constitution, a great sense of the balance and the role of a judge, limited to understanding the Constitution, law, and facts passed in front of her and with a limited role to decide the questions presented based on the law and the facts. We also got to hear about her family, her history, her experiences, her serv-ice, her impeccable legal credentials,  her service on the Sentencing Commission, her work as a trial and appellate court judge, her experience as a clerk at all levels of the Federal judiciary, and her time as a Federal public de-fender. She is a devoted daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend, and someone who is humble enough to say that she knows and loves the Constitution from which our freedoms flow. She stands on the shoulders of those who went before her—her parents, both proud HBCU graduates and the first in her family to go to college. Her uncles and her broth-er served in law enforcement, in the military. She is so well grounded in those institutions and traditions that have made our Nation great; and it fills me with confidence to know that a per-son of this skill, of this background, of this sense of judicial temperament— who endured a grilling that was, at times, tantamount to harassment by other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee—demonstrated her grace, her courage, and her integrity under sustained fire. I very much look forward to the votes we will take in this Chamber later this week, and I will be honored to vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the next Asso-ciate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. CLIMATE CHANGE  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise again, with my increasingly bat-tered poster, to call on this body and in particular on corporate America to wake up to the threat of climate change. Just this week, the IPCC report came out saying that we are now at the do- or-die, last-chance moment. The other interesting thing about that IPCC re-port was that it, for the first time, fo-cused on the role of malicious fossil fuel political influence in preventing the solution. Political influence is actually contributing to the climate change prob-lem, and it is the scientists who are now pointing this out. Well, one of the worst expositors of that political influence, the monster in the middle of that political influence campaign here in the United States, is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And I want to talk about them in a minute; but, first, let’s do just a quick recap be-cause we have known about climate change for a long time. Scientists knew about the greenhouse effect back when Abraham Lin-coln was riding around Washington in his tophat. In the 1950s—in the 1950s— the oil industry began research on the effects of greenhouse gas pollution. In 1977, nearly a half century ago, Exxon’s top scientist warned management of what he called ‘‘general scientific agreement’’—half a century ago, mind you—‘‘general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global cli-mate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels.’’ A Republican-led committee led by my predecessor, John Chafee, held a Senate hearing on climate change in 1986; and in 1989, the Chamber of Com-merce—one of the most influential forces in Washington and now one of the biggest lobbyists for fossil fuel in-terests—the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce issued a report for business lead-ers about the threat of climate change. We have dug out that report because they entered it into the RECORD in a House proceeding later that day, and here is what that report said. I will quote at some length. [T]here is qualitative agreement among prognosticators that sea levels will rise . . . wetlands will flood, salt water will infuse fresh water supplies, and there will be changes in the distribution of tree and crop species and agricultural productivity. A significant rise in sea levels will flood now inhabitable land in some countries. . . . These same actions will affect wetlands and it may not be possible [to] protect both coastal and wetland areas. Georgia, very susceptible to this, as the Presiding Officer knows. Flooding will intrude into water supplies, such as in coastal cities (e.g., Miami and New Orleans). . . . Changes in temperature patterns will affect natural ecosystems by altering the distributions of species, and af-fecting forestry and silviculture. . . . [C]rop lands will change. . . . The stress will depend on changes in precipitation patterns. Global warming will affect snowfall patterns, hence melt, and affect water supplies. Most of California’s water supplies are from snow melt and if snow is reduced to rain, or melts quickly during the winter, water sup-plies in the summer will be less than now. Does any of that sound familiar? Of course. It is what we are looking at around us now, and it is what the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted in 1989. Knowing that, what did the chamber do? I will tell you what the chamber did. Over the past two decades, every time Congress took up good climate bills, the chamber conspired to kill them. The reason is pretty simple: The chamber serves as the arm of the fossil fuel industry. It takes its money, and it does its dirty work. A couple of years ago, a witness at our Special Committee on the Climate Crisis explained how big trade groups like the chamber ‘‘adopt the lowest common denominator positions on cli-mate of their most oppositional mem-bers.’’ Fossil fuel pays the chamber to kill anything that threatens what the IMF estimates is an over $600 billion annual subsidy for fossil fuel in the United States. On climate, it is not the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; it is the ‘‘U.S. Chamber of Carbon.’’ Here are some of the corpses in the chamber’s legislative graveyard. In 2005, the chamber opposed bipartisan cap-and-trade legislation. It issued a ‘‘key vote alert,’’ a signal that whoever voted in favor of the bill could face an onslaught of political attack ads. Down the legislation went. The chamber used the same playbook to kill cap-and-trade bills in 2007, in-cluding the aptly named Wake up to Climate Change bill that had started to gain steam until the ‘‘Chamber of Car-bon’’ dug in against it. In 2009, the chamber led the charge against the most promising climate bill in decades: the Waxman-Markey bill. The chamber spared no effort kill-ing it. It harangued members, issued more vote alerts, and published ‘‘How They Voted’’ scorecards, with a clear message: Cross us and we will come after you. Since then, the chamber’s axis of influence in Congress has refused to hold hearings on, mark up, debate, or vote on any serious climate legislation. At the same time, the chamber fought climate action in the courts and in executive Agencies. Here are a few of their cadavers there: In 2010, the cham-ber sued EPA to overturn the finding that greenhouse gas emissions endan-ger public health and welfare. Dis-abling that ‘‘endangerment finding’’ would cripple the Agency’s ability to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. When courts rejected the chamber lawsuit, the chamber then set up as central command for fossil fuel law-yers, coal lobbyists, and Republican po-litical strategists, who devised the legal schemes to fight climate regula-tions. This produced another chamber lawsuit to block the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power-plants. And on this occasion, five Re-publican appointees on the Supreme Court killed the Clean Power Plan using the shadow docket. They didn’t even have proper hearings on it. Once President Trump took office, the chamber began attacking and undoing Obama administration rules limiting carbon pollution. The cham-ber even funded the phony and de-bunked report that the Trump adminis-tration relied on to justify leaving the Paris accord. The chamber’s climate obstruction has continued across all fronts under President Biden. It released a position paper championing ‘‘clean’’ coal, which is right up there next to dry water and chilly heat. And, of course, it led the charge against our reconciliation bill, attacking more than $500 billion in cli-mate-related investments. To make all this dirty work possible, the chamber weaponized the dark money powers afforded by the Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United. The chamber knew the power that this de-cision would grant them. Indeed, it filed an amicus brief in that case, tell-ing the Court to knock out limits on so-called outside spending. And Citizens United then allowed outside groups to spend unlimited sums on electioneering activities, which teed up the chamber to funnel roughly $150 million into congressional raises. And they bought a lot of climate denial with that money. It made them the  largest spender of dark money in congressional races. Dark money talks, as we see every election on our television screens. But every bit as important, dark money threatens. Republican colleagues have told me how this works. When a Republican dares to engage with Democrats to do something about climate change, a warning shot flies above their head. Chamber dark money and threats killed Republican support for substan-tial climate legislation. When I got here in the Senate in 2007, there was a steady heartbeat of bipar-tisan climate activity, climate bill after climate bill, hearing after hear-ing. John McCain ran for President as a Republican with a strong climate platform. That all dropped dead in 2010 with that Citizens United dark money power in the hands of the chamber of commerce, which brings us to the present day. American corporations, today, need to tell consumers and shareholders that they care about climate change. They need to for a couple of reasons. First, some of them actually are get-ting hurt by climate change—big insur-ers, the tourism industry, agribusiness. Tropical cyclones, more frequent heat waves, floods and droughts, more in-tense wildfires, higher sea levels—these things cost American businesses enor-mous amounts of money. According to NOAA, America sustained over 300 weather- and climate-related disasters since 1980, where the damage in that disaster topped a billion dollars and the total damage among all those dis-asters is over $2 trillion—$2 trillion lost to uncontrolled climate change, thanks to dark money efforts by the fossil fuel industry and, specifically, its operative, the ‘‘U.S. Chamber of Carbon.’’ Of course, consumers expect corporations to face up to the climate threat. The public wants us to do something and big brands like Coke and Pepsi need to say the right things when it comes to climate. And many of these companies have great internal climate policies within the corporation. But then—but then—those companies turn around and they pay dues to the ‘‘U.S. Chamber of Carbon.’’ And the cham-ber—the corporate serial killer of all things climate in this building—goes out and kills the things that the com-panies say they want. According to a new report from the watchdog group InfluenceMap, the chamber remains one of the biggest im-pediments to climate action in Amer-ica. They said: There has been no material improvement in the Chamber’s climate change policy en-gagement over the past five years, despite its positive ‘‘high-level messaging’’ on climate. InfluenceMap concluded in this report last month: The organization remains a significant blockage to U.S. climate policy. And it is supported by a whole swath of corporate America. Many of us want a phone call with TechNet, the Silicon Valley trade asso-ciation. Ten of its members are mem-bers of the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon.’’ They fund climate denial. They think they are doing the right thing on climate, but they are not. They are paying the biggest monster in the middle of a cli-mate denial operation in this country. So when Coke and Pepsi pay dues to the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon,’’ Coke and Pepsi’s corporate net effect on climate legislation goes negative. The chamber keeps secret how much the fossil fuel industry paid it to turn the chamber into a ‘‘worst climate obstructor.’’ It has corralled its pro-climate members into what it calls a ‘‘climate conversa-tion’’ that has been going on since 2019. I know that because I kicked it off. I thought something good might happen. But what has happened in that climate conversation since 2019 is that any-thing good on climate gets routed by the chamber into that climate con-versation from which nothing serious has emerged in more than 2 years. It is where the good climate policy goes to die. It is the black hole of good climate action. In the meanwhile, all the climate evil that doesn’t get sent to the cli-mate conversation goes straight by and out into chamber operations. At the end, the effect is clear: The ‘‘Chamber of Carbon’’ works the will of the fossil fuel industry and blocks climate progress in Congress, and it does so with corporate America’s acceptance and financial support. If the IPC is right that this is last call, that this is dangerous, that this is our make-or-break, do-or-die moment, then it is time for corporate America to tell the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon’’ to knock it off or to quit and disassociate themselves from the ‘‘worst climate obstructor’’ in America. We should no longer tolerate this. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, there has been a lot of conversation in the past several weeks about Judge Jackson’s judicial philosophy—right-fully so. This is a lifetime appointment on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a seri-ous position. I don’t know a single Sen-ator in this room that doesn’t take their responsibility seriously. This is a big issue when you put anyone on the Supreme Court for a life appointment. Everyone has had the opportunity to be able to go through case law, cases that she has handled, things she re-sponded to, things that she has writ-ten, ways that she has responded. Actu-ally, I had time last week to sit down with her for about 45 minutes in the of-fice just to be able to talk and to be able to get back-and-forth with her a little bit. I want to give a little bit of context to that because many Americans watched all the hearings that happened last week—a full week of just conversa-tion with her, asking her all kinds of different questions. I don’t serve on the Judiciary Committee so I am on the outside looking in. That is why I got time individually with her for about 45 minutes to be able to ask her questions and get to know her. By the way, I had folks in Oklahoma say: You had the opportunity to sit down with her; what is she like? To all of them, I answered the same way. She is actually the kind of person you would want to invite over for din-ner, just to be able to sit and visit with—extremely pleasant, outgoing, personable, smart, sharp, wonderful smile and interaction. You would want to invite her over to dinner to be able to visit with. But my decision is not about whether to invite her over for dinner to be able to spend time with. My decision is, How will they handle a lifetime ap-pointment on the Supreme Court and how will they handle the law? The difficult part of this conversation has been interesting. It really cir-cled around judicial philosophy. How would you handle cases? We can’t ask: How are you going to actually rule on this specific case? Be-cause if she answers, then she has to recuse herself from that case in the days ahead, and everyone knows that. So we are always trying to determine: How will you treat cases in the days ahead and what lens will you look through? That is a reasonable con-versation. Her response has been interesting. Her response was that she had a ‘‘meth-odology’’ as a judge, and it has three aspects to it: Neutrality, which is a good thing; receiving all the appro-priate inputs, which is making sure ev-eryone is heard; and looking at the fac-tual record and the text of the statute. That is actually a very good starting point with this. The question then goes to the next set of questions on it: How do you han-dle the U.S. Constitution and where does that document fit in? Is it living? Is it changing? Is it the original text and the meaning of it, or does it have a living version that changes? That is a reasonable conversation because there have been different Jus-tices on the Supreme Court that have handled that differently. The late Justice William Brennan wrote: For the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs. Well, that is not an original meaning in the original context and locked into that. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: The Constitution that I interpret and apply is not living, but [it is] dead, or as I prefer to call it, enduring. It means, today, not what current society, much less the court, thinks it ought to mean, but what it meant when it was adopted. In other words, those words had meaning at that time. They couldn’t  predict what those words might mean 100 years from now. They could only deal with what those words mean right now. And if it is going to have a dif-ferent meaning at a different time, well, then, there has to be different law to be able to deal with that at a dif-ferent time. We never got a really clear answer on that. We get things toward her methodology. That is a critical issue to be able to deal with. There were issues about sentencing that came up and how she chose to do sentencing when she was at the district court level and handled cases. They were all over the news about some cases that she handled that were very lenient in the sentencing. There were also a lot of questions about the Second Amendment or about due process. There was kind of the moment of the judicial hearings when Senator BLACK BURN asked—not a trick question but a real conversational question—about how you handle the law and culture. And that is, Can you define a woman? I honestly don’t think that Senator BLACKBURN meant for that to be a trick question, but it really is a question in culture at this point. It will determine how you are going to handle the law and to be able to read the law. Her response was she couldn’t answer the question of how to define a woman because she is not a biologist. Well, I am not a biologist either, but I think I can define that question. And it is just a conversational issue that we have as a nation to be able to determine: Let’s deal with things that are self-evident. There were all those issues that were dealt with during the hearing time, but when I got with her, I didn’t want to go back and revisit those issues. I wanted to spend time with her talking through the things that weren’t actually dis-cussed. Obviously, it was over days of her hearings. There were several issues dis-cussed about how she handles the law. One of those is Tribal law. In some areas of the country, this is a very big deal and in some areas, not at all. So I understand why it didn’t come up in the hearings. In her past history in her cases, she has had one case to deal with Tribal law. So there are a lot of questions to be able to talk about. Oklahoma is very proud of who we are as a State. We have great diversity as a State. We have a unique relation-ship in Indian Country in our State. I thought it was important for us to be able to talk about the relationship that our State has with 39 Tribes and, quite frankly, the history our State has, as we were the State where Tribes were relocated to from the Southeast. We spent a lot of time talking about that. We talked about issues of religious liberty, First Amendment issues, how you handle those cases. There are dif-ferences even in the Court, even on what is the more liberal side of the Court. Sotomayor and Kagan often dis-agreed on issues of religious liberties. They handle it with a different perspective, and it is not uncommon for a reli-gious liberty case to come up and Sotomayor and Kagan to be on either side. So, quite frankly, I was trying to discern: Is this person more like Sotomayor or more like Kagan on how to handle the issues of religious lib-erty? It didn’t come up a lot in the hearings, but I really think that is a foundational issue. Quite frankly, this is the fourth Supreme Court Justice I have had the op-portunity to be able to sit down with personally, and with each of them, the issues that I just brought up were the issues that I talked with all four of them about because they don’t often come up in the other issues, but to me it is foundational. We have three branches of government defined by our Constitution. Those branches are coequal, and they check each other. And it is exception-ally important that they really do check each other; that the legislative branch doesn’t just give it away to the executive branch or to the courts or that the legislative branch doesn’t run over the courts or the executive branch and neither can the executive branch or the judicial branch do for either. But if the judicial branch sits passive at a moment that they should engage, the other two branches are not checked or if the judicial branch engages in a moment when they should be silent, they have exceeded their authority as well. It is exceptionally important that the three branches both check each other and also know their lane and do their lane well. There are two cases that popped out that became very significant to me and were part of our conversation as well. There was a case that came up during the Trump administration when Judge Jackson was at the district court level and dealt with this issue of expedited removal. Now, it is my guess that she doesn’t like the expedited removal process in immigration, but I didn’t ask that; I didn’t drill down on that, so it was only my guess. But what was in-teresting was she ruled on a case on ex-pedited removal and forbid the Trump administration from actually putting in place what they did and did it na-tionwide. The problem was, when that was appealed up to the DC Circuit Court, the DC Circuit Court actually reversed Judge Jackson’s preliminary injunc-tion and reminded Judge Jackson, at that point, that the way the law was written made this statement: that the Secretary had ‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion.’’ She literally reviewed a decision made by a Secretary, where specifi-cally in the law it stated a judge can-not review this decision, though she overturned it, only to go to the circuit court and have them overturn her. That tells me a balance of power issue, of knowing what your lane is and de-termining how that lane is taken on. There is another case that came up, actually during the Trump administra-tion as well, when Judge Jackson was also in the district court, and she dealt with the issue about what unions could do and what the executive branch could do in relationship to unions. It has been a contentious issue, quite frankly, for decades. It is entirely rea-sonable to be able to have that kind of dialogue about it. She ruled in the favor of the unions, and the DC Circuit, again, reversed her decision when it came there, but it is not just that they reversed her decision, it is that they reversed her decision, and this was the statement from the DC Circuit: We reversed because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In other words, that is not your responsibility in that lane. Specifically, that kind of issue has to be taken up by the Federal Labor Relations Board. In statute, it says it can’t go to a district court; it has to go to a different place. Typically, other judges look at it and say, ‘‘You can’t be in this spot to be able to argue this,’’ and send it to the correct place. Instead, she ruled on it in favor of the unions and declared it done, until the circuit came back and said: That is not your lane. That is ac-tually the executive branch’s lane. And one of the most interesting dialogues we had to be able to talk through things was the issue about def-erence. Now, why does this matter? Well, for about 80 years, Congress has been writ-ing a law that gets broader and broader and broader. Quite frankly, it has been a problem with both parties. If we want to see something done, we write a broad law; we send it to the executive branch; and we say figure it out. And each executive branch is getting more and more creative on how they figure it out. And we deal with all kinds of regulations, and both parties argue with the executive branch and say: Why do you do that? And the exec-utive branch responds back sometimes: Well, you gave me the ability to make that decision on my own and so I did. This issue of deference and of delegation is a very significant constitutional principle. It is an issue that we have got to resolve here as a body—quite frankly, on both sides of the aisle—to be jealous of the responsibility that we are given in the Constitution. But it is also an issue, I think, that is very important for the courts to be able to engage in because the courts are able to step in uniquely to the ex-ecutive branch in a way the legislative branch cannot. The legislative branch can complain about it, but the courts actually can look at it and say, ‘‘You are out of your lane,’’ to the executive branch. And if the court is passive in this, then whoever the executive is gets to run. One of the clearest examples of those is something that is called Chev-ron deference or our deference. I won’t go into all the details on it, but it basi-cally says, if a piece of legislation, the  way that it is written, is ambiguous, then the executive branch can inter-pret it the way that they choose. I have a problem with that interpretation because I believe if the law was written poorly, we shouldn’t just give it to the executive branch and say: Fig-ure it out. What do you want it to mean? If it doesn’t mean something clearly, it doesn’t mean anything at all. Now it is about two issues: One is a constitutional issue. If you go back to 1803, Marbury v. Madison is a foundational piece for the Supreme Court. This is the piece that has come up over and over again over the last two centuries. The foundational statement that came out of Marbury v. Madison was this simple statement: It is emphatically the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. If the judicial hands to the executive and says, ‘‘We can’t tell what the law says, so we will give it to you,’’ it is literally the judicial handing to the ex-ecutive something that is uniquely the judicial’s power. Now, this is no simple issue. This goes back to our balance of power. What we have is a situation now over the past several decades where Con-gress has given its power to the execu-tive branch. If the judicial branch does the same, giving its power to the exec-utive branch, we have a rising execu-tive branch and the other two bodies will look at it and say: How did that happen? Because we gave it away is how it happened. And we have a more and more powerful President of either party and a less and less powerful Con-gress and judicial branch. In my conversation with Judge Jackson, she repeated over and over to me that the court is limited, the court is limited, the court is limited. And I said, yes, they are limited, but they have a responsibility, and the court’s responsibility is to say what the law is. And at the moment—as I said to her, if I threw letters on the table, the exec-utive branch doesn’t have the ability to say: I will make them say whatever I want to. I can’t—if a law was written and the law said, ‘‘Orange, penny, Ford, desk, Reagan,’’ now all those are English words, but, quite frankly, they don’t really make a sentence. The authority shouldn’t be given to the executive branch to be able to figure out what they could make of that. The responsi-bility should be in the judicial branch to be able to look at that and say: That means nothing. Congress, go do your homework. Clean it up. The executive branch can’t just make it mean what they want it to say and say what the law is. Congress has to say make it clear and the judicial branch has to say what the law is and the executive branch has to apply it. Now, again, this is very philosophical, but it is also foundational in our constitutional construct. It is why I find myself in the position of voting no for someone I personally liked when I met her but do not align with on how you handle the Constitution, separa-tion of powers, and the responsibility of the court to align with original in-tent of the Constitution. This is not a new dialogue for us in the Senate body. It is a conversation we have had for two centuries that is still unresolved for us. But we cannot select individuals that are not com-mitted to the original meaning of the Constitution and can hand to the exec-utive branch what the law says. This is one that we need to guard. And so for that reason, when the vote comes tomorrow on Judge Jackson, I will vote no. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. I rise today in strong support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-son’s confirmation as our Nation’s next Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Oftentimes, the debate in the Senate on judicial nominations loses sight of the personal stories of those who are put before us, so let me start there. Let me start by talking about where Ketanji Brown Jackson came from to reach this extraordinary point where we are poised to write an important chapter of progress in our Nation’s his-tory. Ketanji Brown Jackson was born in our Nation’s Capital and grew up in Miami. She is the daughter of two former public school teachers, who themselves were raised in the Jim Crow South. Two of Judge Jackson’s uncles were police officers in Miami, one who ultimately became the police chief. Her brother served in the U.S. Army and as a police officer in Balti-more. Judge Jackson attended public school in the Miami-Dade County school system. She credits her father for starting her on a path to the law, as he went back to school to earn a law degree and became a lawyer working for the school board. Family, education, hard work, public service, all guiding Judge Jackson on the path that brought her to this mo-ment, to today. She was elected mayor of her junior high school class and president of her high school class. She grew to be a standout on the speech and debate team. And when her high school coun-selor told her not to set her sights too high, she never accepted the limits of others—she persevered. Judge Jackson went to Harvard where she graduated magna cum laude. She went to Harvard Law School where she was a top student and editor of the prestigious Law Review. Following graduation from law school, this nominee worked for three consecutive Federal judges, culmi-nating with a clerkship from 1999 to 2000 for Supreme Court Justice Breyer. As Judge Jackson has said, this is the lesson she took from her experi-ence: Justice Breyer exemplified every day, in every way, that a Supreme Court Justice can perform at the highest level of skill and in-tegrity while also being guided by civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit. Guided by her belief in the power and promise of the Constitution and this Nation’s founding principles—freedom, liberty, and equality—Judge Jackson went on to serve as an assistant Fed-eral public defender in the DC Circuit, representing defendants who did not have the means to pay for a lawyer. When confirmed, Judge Jackson will be the first former Federal public de-fender to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. And to me, this is an extremely important qualification that Judge Jackson holds and will bring with her to the Supreme Court. As a former public defender, she had firsthand experience delivering the Constitution’s promise of due process. This promise, given to all Americans without regard to financial means or political connections, is an essential element of our system of justice. We all should want this experience and the perspective it brings on our highest Court because it is a funda-mental protection in our justice sys-tem. Judge Jackson has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate three times previously. She was first confirmed by the Senate to serve as the Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Following in the footsteps of Justice Breyer, she would become the only member of the current Court who previously served as a member of that bipartisan, inde-pendent commission dedicated to re-ducing sentencing disparities and pro-moting transparency and proportion-ality in sentencing. Next, after President Obama nominated Judge Jackson to be a district court judge for the District of Colum-bia, she was once again confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2013. During Judge Jackson’s 8 years on the bench as a dis-trict judge, she issued more than 500 written opinions. And last year, she was again confirmed by the U.S. Sen-ate with bipartisan support to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-trict of Columbia Circuit. In confirming her to each of these positions, the Senate voiced its con-fidence in Judge Jackson’s character, integrity, and intelligence. Experience matters, and the fact is, Judge Jackson is as qualified and experienced in the law as any nominee in our Nation’s his-tory, bringing more experience as a judge than four of the current Justices did combined at the time they joined the Court. This strong experience has provided her a clear understanding of the role of a judge and the role of the judiciary in our system of government. As she has said herself, ‘‘A judge has a duty to decide cases based solely on the law, without fear or favor, preju-dice or passion.’’ That is precisely why she has a proven record of being faithful to the Con-stitution and being an independent,  fair, and impartial judge. That is why Judge Jackson has earned the support of the law enforcement community, in-cluding the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, as well as victims of crime, including domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. I had the pleasure and, in fact, joy of meeting with Judge Jackson last week. No fairminded person can deny her im-pressive credentials and experience, and no one should deny the moment she has rightfully earned to be consid-ered for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. Our meeting wasn’t long, but it was long enough for me to know that she has a quality that everyone we work for wants in a judge and certainly in a Justice on the Supreme Court. She knows how to listen, and I have every confidence that Judge Jackson under-stands how important that quality is for a judge to carry out their responsi-bility and commitment to the rule of law. Judge Jackson’s lifetime of hard work and perseverance has prepared her well for this inspiring moment. I believe the people I work for in Wis-consin agree. A young high school student in Milwaukee recently said: Knowing she is the first person to do that, it like, gives me the idea that I can do big stuff too. Jada Davis, the first Black woman to be crowned Miss Milwaukee and a law student at Marquette University, said this: The more you see yourself in other people the more confidence you will have to do those same things or go after what you want. I know Judge Jackson has the character, temperament, and experience we want in a Justice on our highest Court. I also know what this moment means to thousands of girls across Wisconsin who, after Judge Brown Jackson’s con-firmation, will have even more proof that they can achieve ‘‘big stuff’’ too. I believe she has a deep appreciation for the fact that the Supreme Court makes decisions that have a profound effect on the lives of all Americans and that she will work to serve and protect the constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans. I will proudly vote for this historic confirmation, the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KELLY ). The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my colleague from Wisconsin, and I rise as well regarding the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Asso-ciate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. As some of you will recall, one of our colleagues from New Jersey, Senator BOOKER , delivered unusually poignant and unscripted remarks recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee about Judge Jackson’s nomination and credentials and character. He moved many of those who were present to tears and spelled out as only he can what this nomination means for our Nation and particularly for the millions of Black Americans who look at Judge Jackson and see their own mothers, their own daughters, their own sisters, and their own friends. Unfazed by the unfair attacks that day on Judge Jackson, our colleague said these words: Nobody is going to steal my joy. I second that emotion. This historic moment and this historic nominee bring me great joy as well. For the next several minutes, I am going to talk about Judge Jackson’s impeccable qualifications. I am going to discuss her sterling record as a pub-lic servant, including nearly a decade as a Federal judge, that makes her su-premely qualified to serve on our Su-preme Court. I also want to talk for a bit about the historic nature of this nomination and attempt to put in context just what it means for our Nation and for me per-sonally to cast a vote to confirm the first Black woman to serve on the Su-preme Court, because today, indeed, it brings a lot of us real joy in this body to know that we have the opportunity and the privilege to play a small part in Judge Jackson’s confirmation. Similar to President Reagan delivering on his promise years ago to nomi-nate the first woman—Justice Sandra Day O’Connor—to the Supreme Court, President Biden has delivered on his own promise. He has nominated the first Black woman to the highest Court in our land, and our Nation can be proud of the nominee we are here to de-bate and to confirm. Let me begin, however, by taking just a moment to thank Justice Ste-phen Breyer for his exemplary service to our country. As many of our colleagues know, Justice Breyer was nominated to the Su-preme Court by President Clinton in 1994, when I was serving as Governor of Delaware. Our Presiding Officer was an astronaut up in the ether above our planet. Justice Breyer was confirmed, some will recall, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote—87 to 9. Justice Breyer served our country with distinction for over six decades, including as a corporal in the Army Reserve, a Federal circuit court judge, and for nearly three decades on the Bench of the highest Court in our land. Justice Breyer is known as a consensus builder on the Bench—a trait I have long admired in judges dating back to my time as Governor of Dela-ware, when I had the opportunity to nominate literally dozens of highly qualified individuals to serve on Dela-ware’s highly respected courts. Over the past three decades, Justice Breyer has helped forge principled com-promises to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans and to uphold the rule of law. During a small ceremony at the White House in January when Justice Breyer first announced that he would be retiring, he brought with him a pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution. In his brief remarks, Justice Breyer re-minded us of how Lincoln and Wash-ington and so many other giants of American history have described that document, our Constitution. They de-scribed it as an experiment. As Justice Breyer reminded us, during the time of Washington and Lin-coln, there were plenty of folks who doubted our system of government could ever work, plenty of folks who said: Well, that is a great idea in prin-ciple, but it will never work, at least not for long. But, as Justice Breyer said that day—he said: It is our job to show them that it does work and it will continue to work. Our Constitution has made possible the greatest experiment in democracy in the history of the world. Over the past several years, I have spoken any number of times on the Senate floor about the wisdom of the Framers of our Constitution. In the hot summer of 1787, they met in Philadelphia, as you will recall, and designed an intricate system of checks and balances. Article I dealt with the Congress; article II dealt with the executive branch of our government; and article III, the judici-ary. America is the longest running experiment in democracy, and our Con-stitution is more replicated across the globe than any other Constitution in the world. But our Constitution has never been perfect. The Framers never pretended that it was perfect. This past weekend, I was privileged to give the keynote address during a commissioning ceremony at the Port of Wilmington for a new Virginia-class, fast-attack, nuclear submarine that bears the name of Delaware—the first Navy vessel named after the State of Delaware in over 100 years. At the end of my remarks, there was a crowd of about several thousand people gathered on the Delaware River, right beside the submarine and its crew. Among the folks in that crowd were the President of our country and the First Lady of the United States, Dr. Jill Biden, who was the sponsor of the boat. I asked everyone there to stand and hold hands and join me in reciting the preamble to the Constitution, which begins something like this: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union— It doesn’t say ‘‘a perfect Union’’; rather, it says ‘‘a more perfect Union.’’ Why is that? Because our Framers un-derstood that this would be an experi-ment and that it would be up to each generation that follows to decide how this experiment will proceed and if it will succeed, up to each generation to face those who say that this great ex-periment in democracy will never work. It is through our actions on days like this that we show them that it does  still work. Judge Jackson’s nomination is proof that, indeed, we have made this Nation more perfect over time and that despite our divisions—and we have them—generations of Americans have worked together, often across party lines, across State lines, across philo-sophical lines, to make a nomination like this possible. Like many Americans, I have seen remarkable progress in my own life-time. While my sister and I were born in a coal-mining town in Beckley, WV, we were raised in Danville, VA, right on the North Carolina border, just north of Greensboro. Danville, VA, was known as the Last Capital of the Confederacy. Forced to flee Richmond after Union victories started piling up in early 1865, Confed-erate President Jefferson Davis actu-ally held his Cabinet’s last meeting— their last meeting—in Danville, where I grew up. He did that a few days before Lee surrendered to Grant at Appo-mattox. Although it was nearly a century after the Civil War ended when my family moved to Delaware—nearly a century—racial prejudice and discrimi-nation still prevailed there. Growing up, my sister and I witnessed racism up close and personal. Every morning, for example, our schoolbus would take us to an all- White high school 10 miles away from our home, and about half an hour later, another schoolbus would come by and pick up Black students who had been waiting along with us and take them to their school, past my school and an-other 10 miles to their school, which was not a better school. It was a school that none of us would be especially proud of. If my sister and I went to lunch with our family, we would sit at the lunch counter, but Black families were de-nied service. If we went to the movie theater in Danville, VA, we sat on the ground floor; the Black patrons had to sit up in the balcony. That is the America many of us lived in not all that long ago—the same America that Judge Jackson’s parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, were born into. It was an America where dis-crimination on the basis of race was sanctioned by State governments; an America where the judicial doctrine of ‘‘separate but equal’’ was still en-shrined into our laws by the Supreme Court; where arbitrary literacy tests kept Black Americans away from poll booths; an America that treated back Americans like second-class citizens despite a civil war, an Emancipation Proclamation, and ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to our Constitution. It was an America that was far from perfect. But through decades of struggle, and thanks to the heroes of the civil rights movement, our Nation began to con-front injustice in our communities and inequality in our laws. And thanks to brilliant Black lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Wilmington, Delaware’s Louis Redding, a number of legal chal-lenges to America’s separate but un-equal classrooms went all the way to the Supreme Court. And perhaps the greatest decision in the Supreme Court’s history, Brown v. Board of Education declared to the Na-tion that the principle of separate but equal could never truly be equal. Brown v. Board of Education did not make our Nation perfect. But it was proof that when the Supreme Court is at its best, America and our Constitu-tion are at their best. The Supreme Court changed the America that my sister and I lived in— that Judge Jackson’s parents lived in— for the better. Combined with the land-mark civil rights bills of the 1960s, in-cluding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it made the America that Judge Jackson was born into more perfect than it was for the generations that came before her. And I hope and pray that each generation will continue to recognize the uniquely American opportunity that our Constitution affords us—the ability to change our communities and our laws for the better—and take on the task themselves. As Judge Jackson stated in her confirmation hearing, her parents taught her that—and I want to quote her. This is a quote from her: Unlike the many barriers that they had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be any-thing I wanted to be. And, my goodness, did she work hard. The daughter of two graduates of HBCU colleges, Judge Jackson was a star on her high school debate team and was elected ‘‘mayor’’ of Palmetto Junior High School and student body president of Miami Palmetto Senior High School. Judge Jackson then grad-uated magna cum laude from Harvard University and cum laude from Har-vard Law School, where she was an edi-tor of the Harvard Law Review. She clerked for not one, not two, but three Federal judges, including for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Judge Jackson could have done anything she wanted with a resume like that—anything—including pursuing any number of well-paying opportuni-ties in the legal profession. Instead, Judge Jackson chose public service, in part because service was instilled in her by her parents, both of whom were public schoolteachers. And public serv-ice, no doubt, runs in her family. Her younger brother felt a similar call to serve. After graduating from an-other fine HBCU university, Howard University right here in Washington, Judge Jackson’s brother enlisted—en-listed—in the U.S. Army right after the 9/11 attacks. He was deployed to Iraq. He also ended up going to Egypt. And then following in the footsteps of two of Judge Jackson’s uncles, he became a Baltimore police officer. When I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Jackson in my office last month, we talked about a wide range of things. Among them, we talked about the diversity of her professional experi-ence, including her time as a public de-fender right here in the Nation’s Cap-ital. As most of us know, public defenders work very long hours for very little pay. They represent clients who cannot afford an expensive lawyer, and in some cases, they cannot afford any lawyer at all. But our system of gov-ernment affords every person charged with a crime the presumption of inno-cence, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a competent defense. It is a testament to the character of Judge Jackson that she is so com-mitted to equal justice under the law that she was willing to commit the early stages of her career to this im-portant work. If confirmed, Judge Jackson would be the first Supreme Court Justice to have served as a Federal public de-fender in this Court’s long, storied his-tory and the first with significant criminal defense experience since Jus-tice Marshall. Now, in 2005, I voted to confirm Chief Justice John Roberts to the Supreme Court; not every Democrat did that. As you may recall, he was appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican. Some of my colleagues might remember, before Chief Justice Roberts was ever nominated to a Fed-eral judgeship, he worked in private practice where his firm represented an individual appealing a death penalty conviction for the murder of eight peo-ple. During his 2005 confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts was asked about it and stat-ed—and I want to quote him right now. Here is what he said: In representing clients, in serving as a lawyer, it’s not my job to decide whether that’s a good idea or a bad idea. The job of the law-yer is to articulate the legal argument on be-half of the client. Chief Justice Roberts likened this work to John Adams defending British soldiers after the Boston Massacre, saying that Adams: . . . helped show that what our [Founding Fathers] were about was defending the rule of law, not undermining it. And that prin-ciple that you don’t identify the lawyer with the particular views of a client or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the cli-ent is critical to the fair administration of justice. Like Chief Justice Roberts, Judge Jackson has lived up to the values set out over 230 years ago, and in doing so, she has protected and defended our Constitution. After her time as a public defender, Judge Jackson served as a vice chair for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. She was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. Judge Jackson was then nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Dis-trict of Columbia. She was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate for that post.  And last year, President Biden nominated Judge Jackson to serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, often-times referred to as our Nation’s sec-ond highest court. Yet again, she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate with bi-partisan support. During the decade that she served as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson estab-lished a track record as a consensus builder, just like Justice Breyer. Dur-ing the decade that she served as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson has been evenhanded and she has been impartial. During the decade that she has served as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson has ruled for and against the government, in favor of prosecutors and for criminal defendants, and for both civil plaintiffs and defendants. As Judge Jackson told our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee recently, she has, she said: a duty to decide cases based solely on the law, without fear or favor, prejudice or pas-sion. Judge Jackson is always guided by our Constitution. And it is why she re-ceived the support of judges nominated by Democrat and Republicans alike, by law enforcement and the civil rights community, and by Republicans and Democrats in this body on multiple oc-casions. Now, these past few weeks, I heard some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle use this confirmation process to mention the unfairness to-ward past nominees. Well, every one of these nominees—every nominee that they referred to received a hearing and a vote. The same cannot be said of Merrick Garland, former chief justice of the DC Court of Appeals who was nominated by former President Obama to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Garland did not receive a hearing. Judge Garland did not receive a vote because our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decided to invent a new rule, and most of them even re-fused to meet with Merrick Garland, one of the finest servants I have ever known. And this shameful blockade led to what many Americans, myself in-cluded, view as a stolen Supreme Court seat, a permanent stain on this body’s reputation and a reduction in the Su-preme Court’s credibility. Then 4 years later, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle broke their own precedent and invented yet an-other new rule to confirm a Supreme Court Justice 8 days—8 days before election day, when tens of millions of ballots had already been cast. And while I will never forget this truly shameful behavior, this week we have a chance to move away from poli-tics. We have a chance to place an ex-tremely well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court and to do so with the support of Senators from both sides of the aisle. In the end, the American people need to trust the Supreme Court to make decisions on questions that impact every single American: whether we have access to clean air is one of those issues, whether we have access to clean water, whether we have access to good healthcare, whether women have the right to make their own healthcare de-cisions. We need a Supreme Court that stays above the political fray. We need a Supreme Court that calls ‘‘balls and strikes,’’ as Chief Justice Roberts once said—a Supreme Court that maintains the trust of the American people as the arbiter of a Constitution that protects the civil rights of all Americans. Judge Jackson will bring a breadth and a diversity of experience to the Su-preme Court not often seen. Judge Jackson’s resume—Harvard; Harvard Law; clerk to three Federal judges, in-cluding Justice Breyer; a public de-fender; U.S. Sentencing Commission vice chairman; Federal district court judge; and Federal Circuit Court judge—is evidence that she is among the most-qualified individuals in our country for this esteemed role. Her character and her intellect are beyond reproach. She weathered a grueling confirmation process with grace and dignity. Let me close by noting that Judge Jackson’s nomination is proof that today in America one’s qualifications and unrelenting work ethic earn you your spot, that public service is valued and commitment to the principles that protect our country do mean some-thing, that the sacrifices of one genera-tion slowly but surely make for a bet-ter America for the next generation. So count me among the millions of Americans who are inspired by Judge Jackson’s life story, a uniquely Amer-ican story that provides proof that our Nation can be made more perfect over time. And it brings this Senator from Delaware, who grew up in Danville, the last capital of the Confederacy, into a much different America. It brings me great joy to be able to cast a vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. And with that I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. MOTIONS TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I look forward to offering two rollcall votes on motions to instruct conferees to the so-called ‘‘competitiveness’’ bill based on the assurances given to me by the majority leader. I am not quite sure when we are going to get to that, but I look forward to offering those two roll-call votes. The first motion would instruct the conference committee not to provide $53 billion to the highly profitable microchip industry without protec-tions for the American people. The second motion would instruct conferees not to provide a $10 billion bailout to Blue Origin, a space com-pany owned by Jeff Bezos, the second- wealthiest person in America, who is also the owner of Amazon. Amazon is a company which, in a given year, pays nothing—zero—in Federal income taxes after making billions in profits; and, by the way, in a given year, Mr. Bezos himself, one of the wealthiest people in the country, has paid nothing in Fed-eral income taxes despite being worth nearly $200 billion. Let me be very clear. Mr. Bezos has enough money to buy a very beautiful $500 million yacht. It looks very nice to me, not that I know much about yachts; but that one looks very nice. Mr. Bezos has enough money to pur-chase a $23 million mansion with 25 bathrooms. I am not quite sure you need 25 bathrooms, but that is not my business—and here is that mansion. So, no, count me in as somebody who does not think that the taxpayers of this country need to provide Mr. Bezos a $10 billion bailout to fuel his space hobby. When all is said and done, both of these motions are—the one on $53 bil-lion for the microchip industry and $10 billion for Mr. Bezos—touch on an ex-tremely important issue that is very rarely discussed in the corporate media or on the floor of the Senate, and that is how we proceed—how we go forward with industrial policy in this country. I should be very clear in saying I believe in industrial policy. I believe that it makes sense on certain occasions for the government and the private sector to work together in a mutually bene-ficial way to address a pressing need in America. Industrial policy, to me, means cooperation between the government and the private sector—cooperation. It does not mean the government providing massive amounts of corporate welfare to extremely profitable corporations without getting anything in return: Here is your check. Do what you want. Have a nice day. In other words, will the U.S. Government develop an industrial policy that benefits all of our society or will we continue to have an industrial policy that benefits just the wealthy and the powerful? In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: The problem is that we all too often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enter-prise capitalism for the poor. I am afraid that what Dr. King said 54 years ago was not only accurate back then but is even more accurate today. We hear a lot of talk around here about the need to create public-private partnerships. That all sounds very good, but when the government adopts an industrial policy that socializes all of the risk and privatizes all of the profits, whether it is handing the microchip industry a $53 billion blank check or giving Mr. Bezos a $10 billion bailout to fly to the Moon, that is not a partnership. That is the exact oppo-site of a partnership. That is corporate welfare. That is crony capitalism. Each and every day, I have heard my Republican colleagues and some cor-porate Democrats blame inflation on runaway government spending. In fact,  one of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus has even suggested that we need to take a strategic pause when it comes to making urgent Federal in-vestments in childcare, healthcare, education, affordable housing, paid family and medical leave, and home healthcare—policies that would sub-stantially improve the lives of the American people. Well, you know what I believe. I believe that maybe—just maybe—the time has come to take a strategic pause when it comes to pro-viding tens of billions of dollars in cor-porate welfare to some of the most profitable corporations and wealthiest people on this planet. The American people are becoming increasingly sick and tired of corpora-tions making recordbreaking profits while ordinary people struggle to pay outrageously higher prices for gas, for rent, for food. They are sick and tired of the high cost of prescription drugs, childcare, housing, groceries. They are sick and tired of CEOs making 350 times more than the average worker while over half of our people live pay-check to paycheck. The American peo-ple are sick and tired of the wealthiest people in our country and the most profitable corporations in some cases not paying a nickel in Federal income tax. What does this so-called competitiveness bill do? Instead of addressing any of these issues, this bill provides $53 billion in corporate welfare to the microchip industry, with no protec-tions for the American people, and a $10 billion bailout to Mr. Bezos. Now, that may make sense to Mr. Bezos, and it may make sense to other corporate leaders, but it does not make sense to me nor do I think it makes sense to the American people. In terms of the microchip industry, the American people should know the truth. We are talking about an indus-try that has shut down over 780 manu-facturing plants in the United States and eliminated 150,000 American jobs over the last 20 years as a result of moving their productions overseas. They have shut down plants in Amer-ica and moved them overseas for cheap labor. In other words, in order to make more profits, these companies closed plants in America and hired people— sometimes at starvation wages—in other countries, and now, believe it or not, these very same people, these very same companies, are in line to receive $53 billion in corporate welfare to lit-erally undo the damage that they caused. Now, some of my colleagues make the point that the microchip industry is enormously important for our econ-omy and that we must become less de-pendent on foreign nations for microchips. I agree. There is no argu-ment about that. But we can and must accomplish that goal of breaking our dependence on foreign countries for microchips without simply throwing money at these huge corporations while the taxpayer gets nothing in return. I suspect five major semiconductor companies will likely receive the lion’s share of this taxpayer handout. They are Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron Technology, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung. These five companies that are in line for a $53 billion bailout made over $75 billion in profits last year. The company that will likely benefit the most from this taxpayer assistance is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I wish them the very best, but let us be clear: Intel is not a poor company. Intel is not going broke—far from it. In 2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in profits. We are talking about a com-pany that had enough money to spend over $14 billion during the pandemic not on research and development but on buying back its own stock to reward its executives and wealthy share-holders. We are talking about a com-pany that could afford to give its CEO, Mr. Pat Gelsinger, a $116 million com-pensation package last year. We are talking about a company that could af-ford to spend over $100 million on lob-bying and campaign contributions over the past 20 years. Does it sound like this company, as well as the others, really needs corporate welfare? I don’t think so. Another company that would receive taxpayer assistance under this legisla-tion is Texas Instruments. Last year, Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 billion in buying back its own stock while it has outsourced thousands of good-paying American jobs to low-wage countries and spent more than $40 mil-lion on lobbying over the past 20 years. That is Texas Instruments. And on and on it goes. So the first amendment that I would like a vote on and expect a vote on would instruct the conference com-mittee to prevent microchip companies from receiving taxpayer assistance un-less they agree to issue warrants or eq-uity stakes to the Federal Govern-ment. If private companies are going to benefit from over $53 billion in tax-payer grants, the financial gains made by these companies must be shared with the American people, not just wealthy shareholders. In other words, all this amendment says is that, if these investments turn out to be profitable as a direct result of these Federal grants, the taxpayers of this country have a right to get a re-turn on that investment. This is by no means a radical idea. These exact conditions were imposed on corporations that received taxpayer assistance in the bipartisan CARES Act, which, as you will recall, passed the Senate 96 to 0. In other words, every Member of the U.S. Senate has already voted for the conditions that are in this amendment. In addition, this amendment would instruct the conference committee to require these highly profitable compa-nies not to buy back their own stock, not to outsource American jobs, not to repeal collective bargaining agree-ments, and to remain neutral in any union-organizing efforts. Again, this is not a radical idea. All of these conditions were imposed on companies that received funding from the CARES Act, and that passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. The second motion that I have introduced touches on an issue that we have very, very rarely discussed on the floor of the Senate. Unbelievably, the so- called competition bill would provide some $10 billion in taxpayer money to Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest per-son in America, for his space race with Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in America. So we are looking at a space race between the two wealthiest guys in America. You know, when I was a young man a few years ago and Neil Armstrong went to the Moon, I recall like yester-day the kind of incredible joy and pride in this country because the United States of America did something that people never ever thought would be possible. Who would have dreamed of sending a man to the Moon? Extraor-dinary. The entire world, not only peo-ple in America, watched that event with bated breath. All over the world, TV sets were on on every continent on Earth. It was just an extraordinary ac-complishment for all of humanity. That is what Neil Armstrong said when he stepped onto the Moon—that it was not just for the United States—but we, of course, our Nation, took special pride because that was an American project. I worry very much that what we are seeing now is not a space race between the United States and other countries as to which nation will return to the Moon or perhaps get to Mars but, rath-er, a space race between Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos—the two wealthiest people in America—as to who will gain con-trol over NASA and future space explo-rations. In other words, if we are able to accomplish the unbelievable, extraor-dinary goal of sending a person to Mars, I want the flag that will be fly-ing on that planet to be the flag of the United States of America, not the flag of SpaceX or Blue Origin. Let us be clear: The $10 billion in this bill for Jeff Bezos and his space com-pany, Blue Origin, is just the tip of the iceberg. The reality is that the space economy, which today mostly consists of private companies using NASA fa-cilities free of charge to launch sat-ellites into space, is already very prof-itable and could become and will likely become even more so in the future. Bank of America predicts that by 2030, the space economy will triple in size to $1.4 trillion. That is ‘‘trillion’’ with a t. According to the most recent data, private corporations made over $94 bil-lion in profits a year for goods or serv-ices that are used in space—profits  that could not have been achieved without the assistance of NASA, a gov-ernment Agency funded by the tax-payers of America. And while we are talking about the profitability of satellites today—and that is already a very profitable indus-try—sometime in the future—not next year, not 10 years from now, but some-time in the future—the real money may come to those who not only pro-vide satellites but those who figure out how to mine lucrative minerals or as-teroids. Does this sound like science fiction? It is not. This is exactly what is being worked on right now, mining lucrative minerals on asteroids. In 2015, the famous astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson, predicted: The first trillionaire there will ever be is the person who exploits the natural re-sources on asteroids ....  There’s this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless re-sources. I look at wars fought over access to resources. That could be a thing of the past, once space becomes our backyard. End of quote, Mr. deGrasse Tyson. Who gets to own the resources discovered by private corporations in space? Well, as a result of a little-known 2015 SPACE Act that passed the Senate by unanimous consent with virtually no floor debate, private corporations are able to own all of these resources. In other words, the taxpayers of this country will get a zero-percent return on the investment they made in these private enterprises, which could turn out to be unbelievably lucrative. Is that what we want space exploration to become? Do we really think that it is acceptable for NASA to hand out billions of dollars to some of the wealthiest billionaires in America today to make them even wealthier? Or do we want to use space exploration to benefit all of the American people and improve life here on the planet for ev-eryone? It is time that we had a serious debate on the future of NASA, instead of just handing out $10 billion to Mr. Bezos. Let me conclude by saying that I happen to believe and support space ex-ploration. I think the benefits could be extraordinary for the American people and for people all over the world. But if we continue down the path of privatizing space exploration, it also has the potential to make the ob-scenely rich even richer and more pow-erful than anyone can possibly imagine today. In my view, we cannot and must not allow that to happen. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado. NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise tonight to support Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to serve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Jackson comes to this floor with impeccable credentials. She grad-uated from Harvard magna cum laude. She graduated with honors from Harvard Law School, where she edited the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, Judge Jackson worked at top firms in private practice and secured three prestigious clerk-ships, including one for Justice Breyer on the Supreme Court of the United States. Later, she served as a public de-fender, representing people who couldn’t afford a lawyer. I can’t think of better evidence of her commitment to equal justice under the law, where everyone, regardless of their means, has the right to fair rep-resentation. Judge Jackson is clearly qualified for this position. There is nobody who doubts that. My colleagues know it be-cause the Senate has confirmed her three times with bipartisan support: first, to serve as Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission; second, for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia; and, last, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Taken together, Judge Jackson comes to this floor with the best legal training America can offer: a decade of experience on the Federal bench and a consistent record of bipartisan support here on this floor. I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Jackson 2 weeks ago, after she had been rolled around in the barrel— that is one way of saying it—during the confirmation hearings that people all over the country watched. And in our conversation, after she had been through all of that turmoil, she told me about how her parents had attended segregated schools in Miami before working as public school teachers here in Washington, DC. Her dad went on to be a lawyer, a lawyer for the Miami school district, something I appreciate, having been a superintendent of schools. Unlike her parents, Judge Jackson grew up in America after the civil rights laws of the 1960s and remem-bered how hard her parents worked every single day to give her opportuni-ties they never even dreamed of for themselves. And she seized those op-portunities. She earned top grade. She was elected student body president. And when she told her guidance counselor she wanted to apply to Har-vard, the counselor warned she shouldn’t set her ‘‘sights so high.’’ For-tunately for America, she set her sights high. She set her sights where they should have been set. She followed the high example of her parents, work-ing hard and impressing everyone along the way, friends and colleagues and mentors, who are virtually beating down the doors of this Capitol to tell us what a thoughtful, fairminded, and principled Justice she would be. That hasn’t stopped some colleagues from distorting her record, trying to say to the American people that she is soft on crime. That would come as news, I think, to the Fraternal Order of Police, who has endorsed her candidacy for the Court. It would come as news to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Both have endorsed her nom-ination. They see what is obvious to anyone who fairly reviews her record, which is that Judge Jackson has spent her entire career devoted to the rule of law. Her brother and two uncles served as police officers. So law enforcement isn’t some academic abstraction for her. It is literally her family. The Presiding Officer knows something about that, I think, in his family history as well. In our meeting, I asked Judge Jackson what makes a good judge. We had a long talk about that. One of the things she said was communication, be-cause judges have to explain their rea-soning in every decision, which is a lot more than I can say for the U.S. Sen-ate. She also said that it is the unique role of the judge to identify and to ex-tract their bias before every case. And if you look at her more than 570 writ-ten decisions, it is clear how seriously she takes that responsibility. I was just on the phone with some people from Colorado before I came over here. And I said to them—I told them I was coming out here to give this speech. And I said to them—these are old, old friends of mine—that I can’t remember a time when I sat down with somebody and had a 30-minute conversation where I came away more impressed than I was by Judge Jack-son. I found her to be both brilliant and completely down-to-earth, which is, I think, a particularly important com-bination for a judge at any level—at any level—to have both the intellect to grapple with the nuances of the law and the experience to appreciate how it affects real people. It wasn’t that long ago that Judge Jackson would have received over 90 votes on this floor, just like her men-tor, Justice Breyer, did; just like quali-fied judges when I was in law school myself. The Senate confirmed Justice Breyer 96 to 3, just like we confirmed Justice Scalia 98 to 0, and Justice San-dra Day O’Connor got 91 to nothing. Somebody was out that day. I guar-antee you they would have voted for her if they had been here. Each time that happened, the Senate reinforced the independence of the ju-diciary, set aside our partisan politics, and stood up, I think, for integrity and for the rule of law. I am sad. I am sad tonight that Judge Jackson won’t get 99 votes tomorrow, even though she deserves it. And that is not a reflection on her. As I said, if this were an earlier day in the Senate, she would get 99 votes. She would have gotten 99 votes if she had come in a dif-ferent era. It is a reflection of how we, as Senators—and I among them—have shredded our constitutional responsi-bility to advise and consent. It is my hope that by the time—I was going to say, when my children are adults; they almost are adults; they  are adults—but by the time they are running the country, with everybody else in their generation, that we will have figured out a way to return the Senate to a place where we take our re-sponsibility—our constitutional re-sponsibility—to advise and consent se-riously, and we find a way to make it, once again, a bipartisan effort in this place, and find a way to stitch our-selves back together again. I am pre-pared to work with anybody on the floor to try to do that. But in the meantime, this really, in my view, is a moment to celebrate. It is a moment to celebrate. In the last few weeks, my office has literally been flooded with messages from Coloradans telling me what an ex-traordinary Justice Judge Jackson would make. And they don’t have to persuade me. Judge Jackson is an in-spiration to me and to so many Ameri-cans, to millions and millions of Amer-icans. In the past few weeks, I couldn’t help but imagine what it would mean to the students I used to work for in the Den-ver Public Schools to see Judge Jack-son on the Court, the same Court that once ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford that her ancestors were little more than property, a Court that codified in Plessy v. Ferguson the segregated schools that her parents were forced to attend and the segregated hotels and buses and movie theaters they endured every single day, day after day. And it is a reminder that change is possible in America. Our country isn’t perfect—far from it. Our history has al-ways been a battle between the highest ideals expressed in our Constitution and our worst impulses as human beings. And if you look at our history, if you really look at our history, the path from cases like Dred Scott and Plessy to Brown and Obergefell was cleared, as it always is, by Americans who refused to give up on our highest ideals; who insisted, as Dr. King once said, that we make real the promise of our democ-racy. This week is a victory for our highest ideals and for the promise of American democracy. It is a moment to celebrate a nation that, as Judge Jackson said, in one generation went from forcing her parents to live under Jim Crow to elevating her to the highest Court in the land. After carefully reviewing her record, I believe that Judge Jackson will join the ranks of Earl Warren, Thurgood Marshall, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justices who have helped bridge the gap between the words written in our Constitution and their reality in Amer-ica today, and I hope she will join the Court’s great dissenters, Justices like Justice Harlan, who opposed decisions that outlawed the minimum wage, or Justices Roberts and Murphy, who re-fused to condone the internment of Japanese Americans in Colorado and across the country. All of those Jus-tices stood not for an ideology but for the American values etched in our Constitution: freedom, equality, democ-racy, and the rule of law. I am confident that Judge Jackson will stand for those values fairly, im-partially, and without prejudice; and tomorrow I will enthusiastically vote for her confirmation. I would suggest that everybody in this Chamber would have a good reason to vote for her con-firmation, and I hope they will con-sider it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. \n",

      "Mr. KING. Mr. President, as the chair of the Senate National Parks Sub-committee and on behalf of Senator DAINES , the Ranking Member of the Senate National Parks Subcommittee, today, I wish to recognize Betty Reid Soskin, who recently retired as the Na-tional Park Service’s oldest active ranger. Betty spent a decade and a half sharing her personal experiences as a ranger at the Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Park in Rich-mond, CA. I want to thank Betty for her service and wish her well in her much-deserved retirement. Betty had a long path before landing at the National Park Service. She grew up in a Cajun-Creole, African-American family in Oakland, CA. Her family was forced to leave their home in New Orle-ans after the ‘‘Great Flood’’ in 1927, and they moved to Oakland to join Bet-ty’s maternal grandfather. After grad-uating from Castlemont High School, Betty went to work as a file clerk in a segregated union hall, Boilermaker’s A–36, during World War II. Later, she and her husband, Mel Reid, opened Reid’s Records, one of the first Black- owned music stores; the store remained open until fall of 2019. Betty also worked for a Berkley city council member and as a field representative in West Contra Costa County for two members of the California State As-sembly. In the early 2000s, Betty was involved in the planning meetings with the city of Richmond and the National Park Service to develop the management plan for the Rosie the Riveter/WWII Home Front National Historic Park. She also worked with the National Park Service on a grant to cover un-told stories of African-Americans on  the home front during WWII, which led to a temporary position working for the National Park Service at the age of 84. Betty became a permanent National Park Service employee in 2011 and has been leading public programs and shar-ing her personal stories and observa-tions with park visitors ever since. Betty gained national fame in 2013, during the government shutdown, when media outlets wanted to interview her as the oldest National Park Service ranger, to get her take on the shut-down. Betty participated in numerous national television interviews but man-aged to stay out of the political fray, saying that she wanted to focus what little time she had left on getting back to work, sharing her stories of the WWII home front. In 2015, Betty was se-lected by the National Park Service to participate in the national tree-light-ing ceremony at the White House and introduced President Barack Obama in the national telecast on the annual PBS special. In fall 2019, Betty suffered a stroke and spent months in therapy, returning to work just before the COVID–19 pandemic struck. Prior to her retirement, Betty started doing weekly virtual visits to continue to share her perspectives with visitors. Like many park rangers, Betty’s path to the National Park Service may not have been the most direct, but we have all benefited from her decision to dedicate herself to public service. Her firsthand experiences on the home front during WWII help provide critical lessons for all Americans, regardless of their age, and we are so thankful that Betty chose to spend so many years of her life sharing her experiences with us all. We will certainly miss her insights and passion, but she has earned this re-tirement. On behalf of myself and Sen-ator DAINES , I extend our best wishes to Betty and thank her again her serv-ice. \n",

      "Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to honor and recognize the contributions of Kay Guinane upon her retirement from the Charity and Security Network. In 2009, Ms. Guinane founded the Charity and Security Network—C and SN—a resource and advocacy center for nonprofit organizations to promote and protect their ability to carry out effec-tive programs that support peace and human rights, aid civilians in areas of disaster and armed conflict, and build democratic governance. Kay formed C and SN after observing significant obstacles in achieving crit-ical humanitarian, peacebuilding and human rights programs. She recognized laws that restricted interactions with and financial support for designated groups and individuals were also se-verely limiting the critical work of civil society programs that provided assistance to the most vulnerable pop-ulations around the world. C and SN blazed a trail in being one of the first nonprofit organizations to address these issues. Early on, in concert with colleagues around the world who had experienced similar impediments, Kay began engaging with elected officials and adminis-tration policymakers, seeking solu-tions, including the committees in Congress responsible for illicit finance and sanctions policy. Kay and her orga-nization were a critical resource for the Senate Banking Committee for years as we addressed important policy issues, and unintended consequences of certain policies around illicit financ-ing, bank de-risking, the conveyance of remittances overseas from families in the US—including large communities of Somalis, Ethiopians, and people from across Latin America—and other issues. In May 2010, Kay testified in the first congressional oversight hearing since September 11, 2001, to look at the im-pact of anti-terrorist financing en-forcement policies on the U.S. chari-table sector. The hearing entitled, ‘‘Anti-Money Laundering: Blocking Terrorist Financing and Its Impact on Lawful Charities,’’ was held by the House Financial Services sub-committee on Oversight and Investiga-tions. During the hearing, a Treasury official acknowledged that the laws aimed at stopping terrorist financing could have the unintended consequence of harming the effectiveness of certain charitable programs. Kay outlined spe-cific problems faced by the U.S. non-profit sector, including the issue of banks freezing accounts indefinitely, and noted the negative impact of U.S. Treasury enforcement actions on le-gitimate charitable organizations oper-ating solely to assist vulnerable popu-lations. Over the next decade, Kay and the work of C and SN were a driving force in efforts to address challenges civil so-ciety groups had in implementing their essential lifesaving, peacebuilding and human rights work. Kay’s vision and efforts built an impressive network of nearly 200 organizations internation-ally with a shared goal of assisting the most vulnerable and protecting funda-mental civil liberties. These organiza-tions addressed issues surrounding civil societal concerns and financial access restrictions for nonprofits to com-bating obstacles in reaching general populations due to specific sanctioned entities. By drawing on legal expertise, firsthand experiences of those working with these limitations, and policy analysis, the work of C and SN has helped raise awareness of and craft solutions for civil society and human rights con-cerns around the world. It has also re-sulted in tangible improvements in regulations, international guidelines, and policies. One notable and tangible  legislative victory was in key provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, which assisted to improve financial access for charities. While her steadfast work will be missed, Kay’s legacy at C and SN and its network of affiliates will have an impact on global civil liberties and human rights issues going forward. I offer her my heartfelt congratulations to her on her retirement, and wish her—and C and SN, which she leaves in good hands—all the best going for-ward. ∑ \n",

      "Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the re-markable career of CW5 David Hammon, a 42-year servicemember of the Illinois Army National Guard who will retire on April 30, 2022. Chief Hammon was the fifth command chief warrant officer of the State of Illinois and only the third full-time soldier to hold the position. Chief Hammon enlisted in the Army as an aircraft mechanic in 1980. He served with the 219th Transportation Company, 40th Aviation Battalion (At-tack Helicopter), 1144th Transportation Battalion, and 1st Battalion, 106th Aviation Regiment. In 1996, he became an aviation warrant officer with the 106th. He served in various units and positions, to include aviation inter-mediate maintenance, light medium transportation, lift, and aviation unit maintenance. His latest assignment was as a maintenance test pilot for Company D, 1st Battalion, 106th Avia-tion Regiment in Decatur, flying the UH–60 Blackhawk. Chief Hammon de-ployed twice in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn. In 2004 to 2005, he deployed with Headquarters, 1st Battalion, 106th Aviation Regi-ment, and in 2009 to 2010, he deployed with Company A, 1st Battalion, 106th Aviation Regiment. His overseas de-ployment training missions include Germany, El Salvador, Panama, Ice-land, and Hawaii. Chief Hammon’s military awards and decorations include Meritorious Serv-ice Medal, Air Medal (Numeral 2), Army Commendation Medal (3 oakleaf clusters), National Defense Service Medal (1 Bronze Star), Iraq Campaign Medal (3 Bronze Service Stars), Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Hu-manitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal (M 2 Device), Overseas Service Ribbon (Numeral 2), Army Reserve Component Overseas Training Ribbon (Numeral 7), Illinois State Active Duty (Numeral 2), Army Combat Action Badge, Master Army Aviator Badge, Army Excellence in Competition Badge Bronze Rifle, Driv-er and Mechanic Badge. Chief Hammon’s leadership, determination, and commitment have no doubt changed lives and helped to make our country safer. As his Army career ends, may he continue to be ‘‘Always Ready, Always There!’’ and forever take pride in knowing that his exemplary efforts and unwavering pro-fessionalism contributed greatly to the success of the Army and the National Guard mission. ∑ \n",

      "Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Col. Gail S. Halvorsen is known as the ‘‘Candy Bomber’’ because in 1948, Colonel Halvorsen brought not only much need-ed supplies to the besieged residents of Berlin, but he brought joy in the form of candy bars and bubble gum with miniature parachutes dropped from his airplane. This story of hope, light, and service is but a highlight in a life dedi-cated to serving others. While Colonel Halvorsen passed away earlier this year at the notable age of 101 years, the people of Utah hold him and his story close to our hearts. Re-cently, my staff and I were honored to join the Gail S. Halvorsen Foundation and other groups in Utah to help facili-tate the donation of six tons of school and baby supplies along with 9,000 let-ters from Utah schoolchildren to refu-gees fleeing Ukraine. While logistical challenges are characteristic of inter-national donations of this type, the dedication of the Halvorsen Founda-tion and all involved ensured these vital supplies made it safely to those within a critical timeline. In a time of violence and evil, when our friends are under attack, Gail Halvorsen is again leading the way for American generosity, kindness, and compassion. The parallels between these two tragic situations are moving. The men and women of America’s mili-tary volunteered in aiding in delivering supplies to those in need. The Halvorsen family and foundation were involved intimately in the effort. Colo-nel Halvorsen’s daughter brought along chocolate bars to induct the Navy pi-lots as some of the next generation of ‘‘candy bombers.’’ These supplies land-ed at Tempelhof airbase where the leg-end began. Now, as then, the people of the United States are showing char-acteristic kindness. It is particularly moving to me that alongside the sup-plies and necessities of life, this ship-ment included touching letters from the schoolchildren of Utah. Gail Halvorsen is remembered not for his ef-ficiency or logistics, but his kindness and gift for human connection. These diapers, packages of formula, and school supplies will be used by the most vulnerable of the Ukrainian refu-gees. This gesture of kindness will lift up weary hands and encourage strug-gling hearts of the mothers and fathers of these children. Importantly, at this moment of difficulty and despair, the Gail Halvorsen Foundation and the people of Utah are also remembering the people behind the tragedy and are remembering kindness, humanity, and an individual touch in the effort to re-lieve suffering. The people of Utah are not unfamiliar with stories of displacement. Utah was settled by religious refugees seeking freedom from persecution and violence. Indeed, the history of the United States is broadly marked by groups fleeing violence, persecution, or turmoil in their homelands. The Amer-ican empathy for refugees and desire to help those in desperate need is alive and well in the hearts and minds of Utahns. Col. Gail S. Halvorsen lived a life dedicated to service. His signature kindness shines brightly in telling his signature story. His glowing smile matched his glowing personality. In Utah, we miss the ‘‘Candy Bomber’’ and his personal touch. Neverthless, his mission and influence continues. The dedicated work of the Gail S. Halvorsen Foundation is changing lives today. Be it caring for refugees, inspir-ing kindness, or building future genera-tions of STEM professionals, the Gail S. Halvorsen Foundation continues the legacy of one of Utah’s greatest citi-zens. Col. Gail S. Halvorsen’s story, his legacy, and his influence carry on bringing smiles and relief all along the way. ∑ \n",

      "Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, while it is not possible to specifically recognize every Vietnam veteran who honorably served our Nation, each time we cele-brate one, we also focus our attention on thousands of others, many of whom lost their lives decades ago. Today, I want to honor David Michael Thomas, who followed in the footsteps of his own father, Glenn Elmore Thomas, a personal bodyguard for Dwight D. Eisenhower, and joined the U.S. Army in 1970. Specialist Thomas was stationed outside the Tan Son Nhut Air Field with the 519th Mili-tary Intelligence Battalion, 525th Mili-tary Intelligence Group for 2 years. He received the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with 2 Stars, Vietnam Campaign Medal with 60 Device, Meritorious Unit Cita-tion, and the Army Commendation Medal. Upon his return from Vietnam, he graduated from Western Kentucky Uni-versity in my hometown of Bowling Green and, most notably, met his fu-ture wife, Julia Kirk at the Baptist Student Union. Together, they em-barked on his 40 years of pastoral min-istry in seven different States, finally retiring back in our community. He and Julia are blessed with four children and a host of grandchildren and great- grandchildren. His legacy of serving others, first in the Armed Services and then in pas-toral ministry, continues in a unique way with which I have a personal con-nection. His daughter, Amy Bee, is a constituent service representative in my office in Bowling Green. She is one of the many talented staff members  who help Kentuckians navigate the highly complex problems that they are experiencing with Federal agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, or the Veterans Administration. Men and women who have exhausted every ave-nue of their own resources count on professionals like Amy—and her tal-ented colleagues—to resolve their issues in a timely way. It is a unique and highly demanding form of service and reflects the values modeled by Amy’s father and grandfather. Later this month, David Thomas— and a plane full of fellow veterans—will come to Washington with an Honor Flight Bluegrass excursion. Each one of these veterans has his or her own story to tell, and by sharing a glimpse into the life of David Thomas, we sa-lute them all.∑ \n",

      "Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and En-trepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American entrepre-neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-cess of a small business in my home State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to honor Malvagio’s Restaurant as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for April 2022. Malvagio’s Restaurant brings a taste of Italy to Coeur d’Alene with their sampling of hand-crafted wood-fired pizzas, pastas, salads, and breads. With a dream of bringing their community together with food and a passion for the tradition of wood-fired cooking, owners Svitlana and Matthew Petersen dedicated a year to perfecting the craft and designing an innovative, mobile wood-fired oven. Using this unique oven as the cornerstone of their res-taurant, the couple founded Malvagio’s in 2016. In the 5 years since Malvagio’s first opened its doors, the restaurant has be-come a mainstay of the Coeur d’Alene community. While they have brought smiles to countless faces in their mom- and-pop restaurant, the Petersen’s mo-bile wood-fired oven has allowed the business to branch into catering. Today, Malvagio’s pizzas are a common sight at weddings, parties, and other celebrations across northern Idaho. Thanks to this growth, the restaurant now employs eight Idahoans and is the official dealer of Forno Bravo wood- fired ovens in Idaho. Malvagio’s success is matched only by the Petersen’s dedication to giving back. As the world watched Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Svitlana—a Ukrainian native—and Matthew began serving an authentic Ukrainian dish at Malvagio’s. During the week of March 2, 2022, all proceeds from each purchase of a cup of borscht, a Ukrainian beetroot soup, were donated to Ukrain-ian humanitarian needs. By virtue of these efforts, Malvagio’s has raised thousands of dollars in support of Ukraine and has become a champion of Idahoan entrepreneurship and philan-thropy. Congratulations to Svitlana, Matthew, and all of the employees at Malvagio’s Restaurant for being se-lected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for April 2022. You make our great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.∑ \n",

      "Mr. REED: S. 4019. A bill to protect airline crew members, security screening personnel, and passengers by banning abusive pas-sengers from commercial aircraft flights, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Protection from Abu-sive Passengers Act, a bill that is aimed at eliminating the rash of vio-lence and abuse that is occurring on commercial flights across the country. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Representative ERICSWALWELL of California, who is introducing com-panion legislation in the other body. The goal of our bill is to send a clear signal that individuals who engage in serious abusive or violent behavior on an aircraft or at an airport security checkpoint will be banned from flying. Since 2020, we have seen an extraordinary increase in the number of cases of violence and abuse against crew-members and airline passengers. In 2021, the Federal Aviation Administra-tion received 5,981 reports of ‘‘unruly passengers.’’ Those complaints led to 1,124 investigations, nearly the same number of investigations as the pre-vious 10 years combined. From those investigations, the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, has initiated 350 enforcement actions and proposed $5 million in fines. In February, it was widely reported that the FAA had re-ferred 80 cases to the FBI for criminal investigation. Clearly, these are not minor infractions. Here some recent examples: In December 2021, the FAA proposed a record $52,500 fine against a passenger who tried to open the cockpit door on a Delta flight from Honolulu to Se-attle, struck a flight attendant twice, and threatened him. The FAA also proposed a $45,000 fine against a passenger ‘‘for throwing ob-jects, including his carry-on luggage, at other passengers; refusing to stay seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, refusing to get up, and then grabbing a flight attendant by the ankles and put-ting his head up her skirt.’’ It proposed a $30,000 fine against a passenger on a Jan. 3, 2021, flight from Atlanta for ‘‘allegedly interfering with the flight attendants’ deplaning proce-dures upon arrival. He attempted to gain entry to the flight deck by phys-ically assaulting two flight attendants, threatening to kill one of them, and de-manding them to open the door.’’ Last December, a passenger on Southwest Airlines pleaded guilty to punching a flight attendant in the face multiple times in a May 2021 incident in Sacramento. According to prosecu-tors, the flight attendant was taken to a hospital with injuries that included a swollen eye, a bruised arm, and a cut under her eye that had to be stitched. She also had three chipped teeth, two of which: had to be replaced with crowns. Such actions in any setting would be deplorable and reprehensible, but on an airplane, such behavior can also rep-resent a real threat to all passengers. Clearly, the existing regime of civil and criminal penalties has not been enough to deter the upsurge in cases. We need to send a signal that such types of behavior will not be tolerated. The Protection from Abusive Passengers Act would require the Trans-portation Security Administration, TSA, to create and manage a program which bars passengers who are fined or convicted of serious physical violence and abuse from flying. Transparency and notice will be provided to banned individuals, including guidelines for re-moval. The bill would also perma-nently ban abusive passengers from participating in the TSA PreCheck or Customs’ Global Entry programs. The bill provides appropriate fairness and due process by ensuring that only  individuals who have been assessed a civil or criminal penalty for abusive and violent behavior will be included on the list of banned fliers. The bill also requires the TSA to explain how it will maintain its list of banned fliers, provide an explanation of how long the individual may be barred from flying based on the severity of the offense, and provide how the individual can seek to be removed from the list of banned fliers. I believe this bill strikes the appropriate balance to assure fairness and transparency while sending a strong signal that violent and abusive behav-ior will not be tolerated. I am pleased that the bill is supported by both labor and the airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest Airlines, the Association of Flight At-tendants-CWA, the Association of Pro-fessional Flight Attendants, Transport Workers Union of America, and the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL–CIO. I hope that my col-leagues will join me in supporting this important bill. \n",

Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, where she has been admired by Longhorn football fans for generations; Whereas, due to her important role supporting The University of Texas at Austin Longhorns football team (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Texas Longhorns’’), Big Bertha has an endowment to provide for her care; Whereas, since moving to Austin, Big Bertha has been a witness to football history on multiple occasions, including witnessing the Texas Longhorns win national champion-ships in 1963 and 2005, back-to-back national  championships in 1969 and 1970, 19 conference championships, 8 Cotton Bowl Champion-ships, and many other prominent bowl games; Whereas Big Bertha supported the Texas Longhorns during each of Hall of Fame Coach Darrell K. Royal’s 20 years coaching the Texas Longhorns to a record that in-cluded 167 wins, 47 losses, and 5 ties; Whereas Big Bertha boomed in support of the winning Heisman Trophy campaigns of Texas Longhorns greats Earl Campbell in 1977 and Ricky Williams in 1998; Whereas Big Bertha’s name was given to her on the 50th anniversary of her move to Austin; Whereas Big Bertha is a television celebrity, having been the focus of a 2015 episode of the Arts and Entertainment Network television show ‘‘Shipping Wars’’ in which Big Bertha was shipped to London, England, to participate in a New Year’s Day parade; Whereas photogrammetry is the science and technology used to obtain reliable infor-mation about the size and dimensions of physical objects; Whereas photogrammetry has been used to measure and compare the size of Big Bertha with other large university bass drums and has scientifically proven that Big Bertha is, in fact, larger than other drums that have been claimed to be the ‘‘world’s largest’’; Whereas Big Bertha and her handlers, the ‘‘Bertha Crew’’, are an essential part of United States history and The University of Texas Longhorn Band; and Whereas Big Bertha has been part of many historic performances across Texas, the United States, and the world: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate recognizes— (1) the 100th anniversary of the construction of Big Bertha, one of the largest bass drums in use by a university in the United States; (2) The University of Texas Longhorn Band as an important cultural and historical icon of The University of Texas at Austin and the State of Texas; (3) Big Bertha for her preeminence in band and musical performances, including on the national stage as the star of the show at an historic performance at Carnegie Hall in 1938 and the international stage as part of a New Year’s Day parade in London, England, in 2015; (4) the Bertha Crew and The University of Texas Longhorn Band for their continued legacy of excellence in musical performance and in support of school spirit; and (5) that the ongoing debate between universities in the United States regarding which institution possesses the largest bass drum is reflective of the spirit of competi-tion that has helped the United States reach new heights in academic and scientific achievement and ingenuity for more than a century. \n",

SA 5020. Mr. SCHUMER submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 7108, to suspend normal trade relations treatment for the Russian Federation and the Repub-lic of Belarus, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) The United States is a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is committed to ensuring that the WTO re-mains an effective forum for peaceful eco-nomic engagement. (2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is entitled to enter into agreements with other sovereign states and to full respect of its territorial integrity. (3) The United States will be unwavering in its support for a secure, democratic, and sov-ereign Ukraine, free to choose its own lead-ers and future. (4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Or-ganization (WTO Agreement) and has been a WTO member since 2008. (5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO Agreement creates both rights and obliga-tions vis-a `-vis other WTO members. (6) The Russian Federation acceded to the WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus has applied to accede to the WTO. (7) From the date of its accession, the Russian Federation committed to apply fully all provisions of the WTO. (8) The United States Congress authorized permanent normal trade relations for the Russian Federation through the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). (9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO General Council on March 2, 2022, urging that all WTO members take action against the Russian Federation and ‘‘consider fur-ther steps with the view to suspending the Russian Federation’s participation in the WTO for its violation of the purpose and principles of this Organization’’. (10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has led the Russian Federation into a war of aggression against Ukraine, which— (A) denies Ukraine and its people their collective rights to independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; (B) constitutes an emergency in international relations, because it is a situation of armed conflict that threatens the peace and security of all countries, including the United States; and (C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to participate in international organizations, including the WTO. (11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is providing important material support to the Russian Federation’s aggression. (12) The Russian Federation’s exportation of goods in the energy sector is central to its ability to wage its war of aggression on Ukraine. (13) The United States, along with its allies and partners, has responded to recent aggres-sion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine by imposing sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export controls. (14) The United States cannot allow the consequences of the Russian Federation’s actions to go unaddressed, and must lead fel-low countries, in all fora, including the WTO, to impose appropriate consequences for the Russian Federation’s aggression. SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS. (a) N ONDISCRIMINATORY TARIFF TREAT MENT .—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning on the day after the date of the enactment of this Act, the rates of duty set forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tar-iff Schedule of the United States shall apply to all products of the Russian Federation and of the Republic of Belarus.

      "Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, in a few moments, I will lock in an agreement on a number of important votes tomorrow. First and foremost, we have reached an agreement for the Senate to con-clude the confirmation process of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson tomor-row. We will hold a cloture vote tomor-row morning at approximately 11 a.m., and the final vote for her confirmation is on track to take place at around 1:45 tomorrow afternoon, depending on how many Members wish to speak. It will be a joyous day—joyous for the Senate, joyous for the Supreme Court, joyous for America—but we still have a long way to go. America, tomor-row, will take a giant step to becoming a more perfect nation. I will have more to say on this historic occasion tomorrow, but, for now, I wish to thank my Senate colleagues for working together to advance and fi-nalize this historic nomination to the Supreme Court. Second, I will also lock in an agreement to hold a series of votes on PNTR and the oil ban tomorrow. After many rounds of negotiations with Republicans, we have reached an important and crucial breakthrough. This agreement clears the path to fi-nally approve legislation that will strip Russia of permanent normal trade rela-tions with the United States. It will also allow the Senate to take separate action on an oil ban proposal as we originally sought. These proposals both have the support of the White House, and it is a big, big deal that we are fi-nally getting them done. I wish this could have happened sooner, but after weeks of talks with the other side, it is important that we have found a path forward to getting PNTR done on a bi-partisan basis. I want to sincerely thank Senator CRAPO , who worked in good faith with us, together, and we wouldn’t have reached an outcome—this outcome— without his diligence and good faith. \n",

      "Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Putin absolutely must be held accountable for the detestable, detestable, des-picable war crimes he is committing against Ukraine. The images we have seen coming out of that country, espe-cially out of the town of Bucha, are just pure evil—it reminds us of the worst moments in human history— caused by the evil man, Putin: hun-dreds of civilians murdered in cold blood—men, women, children, the el-derly, the defenseless; people with hands tied behind their backs and left dead on the streets; civilians shot in the back of the head—all for one rea-son: They are Ukrainians. It is one des-picable reason. This is genocide when you murder, wantonly, innocent civilians because of who they are. Whether it be their reli-gion, their race, or their nationality, that is genocide, and Mr. Putin is guilty of it. Formally revoking normal trade relations with Russia is precisely the right thing for the Senate to do be-cause it will land another huge blow to Putin’s economy. It is a key part of  any strategy for holding Putin accountable for his savage attacks on in-nocent civilians. Again, I thank all of my colleagues for their good work and look forward to passing PNTR in the Senate tomor-row morning. \n",

      "Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwith-standing rule XXII, at 10 a.m. tomor-row, April 7, the Senate resume legisla-tive session and proceed to the en bloc consideration of H.R. 6968, the Russian oil ban, and H.R. 7108, the Russia PNTR, both of which are at the desk; that amendment No. 5021 to H.R. 6968 be considered and agreed to; that amendment No. 5020 to H.R. 7108 be considered and agreed to; and that those be the only amendments in order to either bill; that the bills, as amend-ed, be considered read a third time en bloc; that the Senate vote on the pas-sage of H.R. 7108, as amended, and H.R. 6968, as amended; and that with respect to both bills, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table without further intervening ac-tion or debate; further, that upon the disposition of H.R. 6968, the Senate re-sume executive session and vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 860, the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the manda-tory quorum call for the cloture mo-tion with respect to the Jackson nomi-nation be waived; that if any nomina-tions are confirmed during Thursday’s session of the Senate, the motion to re-consider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be im-mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-tion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Idaho. Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for Senator SCHUMER ’s request for unanimous consent for the Senate to proceed to the en bloc con-sideration of H.R. 6968, the Russian oil ban, and H.R. 7108, the Russian perma-nent normal trade relations legisla-tion. I want to thank Senators SCHUMER , WYDEN , W ICKER , PAUL, CARDIN , M URKOWSKI , M ANCHIN , L ANKFORD , R ISCH, MENENDEZ , CORNYN , and S ULLIVAN . It is a long list of Senators who worked hard on this legislation to get us to this point. They exemplify how you can be both principled and reasonable. I want to especially again thank Senator SCHUMER . We did work carefully and long together. We spent tireless days working to try to make sure that this worked out. We, I think, both ac-knowledge that we respect the good faith that each of us has shown in mov-ing this forward and getting it to this point. Thanks to the efforts of all of these Senators, the Senate is in a position to pass these important bills. Impor-tantly, their efforts in this Chamber reflect the best of what Ukraine des-perately seeks to preserve and that which Vladimir Putin is determined to destroy: freedom and representative government. That is why the legislation at issue is so important. It strikes directly at Putin and cuts off the lifeblood for his war machine and his autocracy by ban-ning U.S. imports of Russian energy products, including petroleum, natural gas, and coal. It places Russia and Belarus in the same pariah status as North Korea and Cuba for trade. The congressional action, including the certification criteria in the bills, is critical because it signifies a standing commitment to the Ukrainian people and to our NATO allies that is more durable than Putin’s machinations in Ukraine. This legislation will inspire our allies to take similar actions against Russia. As President Zelenskyy told us when he asked for the ban, ‘‘[It] can be called an embargo [or it can be] just moral-ity.’’ Because this legislation is so critical to the support of Ukraine, we must act in unison on these bills and call on Speaker PELOSI to promptly vote on this legislation in the House, where it will also receive a resounding vote in favor. Therefore, I strongly second Senator SCHUMER ’s request and also ask that the Senate agree to it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend, the Senator from Idaho. \n",

      "Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and service of Offi-cer Jonathan Diaz as the California legislature dedicates the Lemoore overpass for Highway 198 and 19th Avenue in his honor. A Huron native, Mr. Diaz graduated from Coalinga High School. He went on to earn his associates degree in criminal justice from West Hills College. Following his passion for serving his community, he joined the Huron Police Department as a reserve police officer during the summer of 2014. Just one year later, he was named Officer of the Year by the Huron Police Department. He would later join the Lemoore Police Department in 2016, where he earned Officer of the Year in 2018. Mr. Diaz was equally committed to helping those in his community outside of his regular duties. He was involved in the Youth Adult Awareness Program, where he helped to men-tor and guide at-risk children in the commu-nity. He also participated in developing juve-nile awareness programs to teach local youth about the realities of prison and incarceration and put them on a path to success. Through his dedication to his community and his com-mitment to service, Mr. Diaz uplifted so many during his life. Mr. Diaz’s courage, dedication, professionalism, and selflessness was well-known throughout his entire department. He played a vital role in solving a significant number of cases, helping to bring justice to those he swore to protect. While he is missed by his loved ones every day, his service still inspires us all. I ask all my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in hon-oring the life and service of Officer Jonathan Diaz of the Lemoore Police Department. \n",

      "Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Attorney Yemi Kings from Jackson, Mississippi. He graduated from Lanier High School and went on to Tougaloo College. Then, received his law degree from Thurgood Marshall School of Law in 2009. Little did the Kings realize that when he valiantly saved the life of a man, who was tragically shot on Thanksgiving Day in 2021, in Jackson, that he was walking straight into fame’s arena. On Thanksgiving Day 2021, around 4:30 p.m., when there was still a glimmer of day-light outside, Kings’ friends and family were eating dinner. During the celebration, they heard about 15–gun shots from what sounded like an assault rifle close to where they gath-ered. Then they heard someone yelling, ‘‘I have been shot.’’ Kings went outside and saw a man lying on the ground in a pool of gushing blood. He was crying, screaming, and saying, ‘‘Please help me! Don’t let me die!’’ After calling 911, Kings asked him where he was shot. The victim re-plied, ‘‘I can’t feel my arm! Help me! I have been shot! I am fading out! I am dying!’’ Kings grabbed sweaters and shirts from a car, wrapped them in layers and pressed them on the bullet wound until the bleeding stopped. ‘‘I kept pressure on his wound and continued talking to him, telling him that he was going to live.’’ Kings said. Firefighters came and took over. They told everyone to step aside as they did their job. The good Samaritan who courageously saved the person’s life was Deputy Hinds County Attorney Yemi L. Kings. When asked what motivated him to be so daring in such a dangerous escapade, he said, ‘‘One thing that came to mind was that I had to try to help save this man’s life. As a prosecutor, I am always helping people on the other side of tragic situations. I never thought I would ever come that close to a shooting or a shooting victim.’’ Kings is the son of Yemi L. Kings and Terri Lyn Smith. Kings’ motivation is his family. He comes from a large family that includes four brothers, two sisters and one son. He wants to continue being there for his loved ones. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Attorney Yemi Kings for his dedication to serving. \n",

      "Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the groundbreaking of the Michigan World War II (WWII) Legacy Me-morial, which will take place in Royal Oak, Michigan on April 7, 2022. This effort has been a fifteen-year labor of love for a dedicated group of volunteers, many of whom had family members who served in the military, including in World War II, and some who are veterans themselves. In 2007, Honor Flight Michigan began providing one- day trips to Washington, D.C. to allow World War II veterans to visit the national World War II Memorial on the National Mall. Between 2007 and 2010, Honor Flight Michigan oper-ated 33 flights, ensuring that all 1,400 vet-erans on its waiting list made the trip to our nation’s capital. The group then committed itself to creating a memorial in Michigan. Its in-tent is best described in the words of the orga-nization itself: ‘‘The Michigan WWII Legacy  Memorial will serve as a place to gather, remember, and inspire. It is a memorial de-signed with the desire to engage the commu-nity and educate future generations on the vi-sion, values, and heroic efforts of the Greatest Generation.’’ The organization chose Royal Oak as the location for the memorial because of its cen-tral location in the heart of Southeast Michi-gan, and with the strong support of the City of Royal Oak to host the memorial at Memorial Park on Woodward Avenue and Thirteen Mile Road. The memorial has been designed to be educational and interactive and as a center of community activities as well as serving as a place for contemplation and remembrance. This week, after fifteen years of work, ground will be broken for the construction of this important tribute to a defining point in his-tory and to the vital contributions millions of Americans made to the essential cause of winning World War II. So many people have played important roles in guiding this project to this significant day, and it would be impossible to name all of them. But I would like to recognize the Board of Directors of the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial for their efforts: President John Maten, Vice-President Chris Graveline, Secretary Kim Jones, Treasurer J. Michael Mastentuono; board members Debi Hollis, Russell Levine, Judy Maten, Ryan Friedrichs and Molly Gale; and Honorary Di-rector Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Alexander Jef-ferson who served in the legendary Tuskegee Airmen. I would also like to recognize two members of the board who sadly passed away before this occasion: Michael Cameron and former Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson. Madam Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating the groundbreaking of the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial, which I have no doubt will be viewed as a jewel in Southeast Michigan, and in congratu-lating all those who made vital contributions to this truly momentous occasion. \n",

      "Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mas-sachusetts State Lottery as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. Since selling its first ticket on March 22, 1972, the Mass Lottery has generated over $137 billion in revenues, returning over $29 billion in net profit to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These funds have been dis-tributed to all 351 cities and towns in Massa-chusetts as unrestricted local aid, supporting a wide range of initiatives, including public safe-ty, snow removal, road improvements, school staffing and services, programs for seniors, and parks and recreation projects. The Mass Lottery has awarded over $96 billion in prizes to its loyal customers. Prize win-ners have been able to put their winnings to-ward the purchase of homes, sending their kids to college, opening their own businesses, covering medical expenses and making dona-tions to charitable organizations. The Mass Lottery has been a valuable source of additional income for thousands of businesses across the state, and collectively the Mass Lottery’s retail partners have earned over $7.8 billion in commissions and bonuses over the last fifty years. Under the guidance of the Mass Lottery, Charitable Gaming events have given non- profit organizations in Massachusetts opportu-nities to raise money to support their causes while providing social entertainment in their communities. Over the last five decades, Mass Lottery employees have worked diligently to build the Mass Lottery into one of the most successful lotteries in the world. In turn, the Mass Lottery has been a valuable employer in the state, of-fering a wide range of career opportunities with pathways for advancement within the or-ganization. The Mass Lottery will be commemorating ‘‘50 Years of Winning’’ throughout 2022 by showing its appreciation for the customers, re-tailers, communities and employees who are a part of its amazing success story. Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize the Massachusetts State Lottery as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. \n",

      "Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the one-year anniversary of the passing of Representative Alcee Hastings, a civil rights advocate and active leader of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission) for more than twenty years. His work included pro-moting principled foreign policy, human rights, strengthened democracy across Europe, do-mestic and international election observations, and diversity and inclusion at all levels of gov-ernment and foreign policy decision making. Alcee Hastings passed away on April 6, 2021. As a U.S. Helsinki Commissioner, Rep. Hastings served as Ranking Member, Co- Chairman, and twice as Chairman from 2007– 2008 and 2019–2020. He was the first African American Chair of the Commission, and over the full span of his time on the Commission, visited all 57 participating States (pS) of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), 11 Asian and Mediterranean OSCE Partners for Co-operation countries, and attended over three dozen meetings of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA). In addition to holding various leadership positions at the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Alcee Hastings also held offices with the OSCE PA, including Rapporteur of the First Committee on Political Affairs and Security, Vice Chair of the First Committee, Chair of the First Com-mittee, Special Representative of Mediterra-nean Affairs, Vice President of the OSCE PA, President of the OSCE PA, and President Emeritus of the OSCE PA. Alcee remains the only American to hold the office of President of the 323-member body. Alcee brought attention to several issues throughout the OSCE region and pushed to le-gitimize U.S. authority on human rights stand-ards. He was a staunch opponent of Russian attempts to undermine security and stability in Europe and beyond, holding hearings as Chair on Russia’s support for separatists and intro-ducing legislation aiding Georgia following the 2008 invasion by Russia and supporting Ukraine’s democratic gains since the 2004 Or-ange Revolution. He was an outspoken sup-porter of Europe’s largest ethnic minority, the Roma, and he led efforts to address anti-Sem-itism and anti-Jewish violence in OSCE pS. Alcee was deeply engaged in the Middle East peace process, improving relations with Medi-terranean partners, protections for minorities in the Kosovo independence plan, and strength-ening democracy and expansion within the European Union. Thanks to his efforts stress-ing the importance of having election observ-ers monitor U.S. elections, the OSCE PA held its first election observation mission in the U.S. in 2002. Representative Hastings believed that diversity and inclusion in foreign policy was critical for upholding democratic values. This included equal representation across different racial, ethnic, gender identity, sexual orientation, reli-gious and geographic communities, including youth participation. He held hearings, intro-duced legislation, supported programs at the State Department and fellowship programs geared towards promoting minority participa-tion, and worked with European partners on initiatives to meet this end. Alcee Hastings was born in Altamonte Springs, Florida and received his bachelor’s degree from Fisk University in Nashville, Ten-nessee and his law degree from Florida A&M University. Prior to serving in government, he tirelessly fought racial injustice as a civil rights lawyer and activist. In 1979, Representative Hastings became the first African American Federal Judge in the State of Florida when President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the bench. When elected to Congress in 1992, he was one of the first three African Americans to represent Florida since the reconstruction era. He has long championed the rights of minori-ties, women, the elderly, children, and immi-grants. It was an honor to serve with Representative Alcee Hastings in Congress and to have the privilege to work with him on the Helsinki Commission. He was the reason I sought ap-pointment. I am proud to have called him my friend and will be forever grateful to him for in-troducing me to the Commission on which I now serve as Co-Chairman. He is remem-bered by all here and at the OSCE PA. His was a life well-lived. \n",

Kappa Beta Omega Chapter focuses on introducing students to the different options of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the benefits of attending these schools. Mrs. Wilson also served on the Vallejo City Unified School District governing board for 14 years and still attends their meetings to sup-port Vallejo students by addressing community concerns to the district and its board. As a Community Liaison Volunteer for the CC and Amber Sabathia PitCCh-In Founda-tion, Mrs. Wilson has worked to provide free backpacks and school supplies to elementary school children and teachers in Vallejo. She also contributes to an annual scholarship for a high school senior who will be attending an historically Black college or university. Mrs. Wilson is an advocate and a consensus builder for students across the city. Through her extensive work with the school district and other non-profits like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the African American Alliance of Vallejo, and the Solano County Chapter of the Link, Inc., she has directly impacted the lives of so many children. Her husband, a retired teacher, Michael Wilson and their two children, Michael Wilson III, a teacher, and Andrinee Wilson-Tucker, Ph.D., a psychologist, also graduated from Histori-cally Black Colleges and Universities. Mrs. Wilson’s family and the rest of the community describe her as incredibly compassionate, dig-nified, and motivated in supporting students with their education. Madam Speaker, it is evident that Hazel Wilson has dedicated her life to the students of Vallejo through her public service. There-fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today. \n",

      "Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay a tribute to the heroic crew members of Tow Boat US Beau-fort (TBUS). On February 13, 2022, TBUS was alerted to a possible downed aircraft east of Cape Lookout shoals near Drum Inlet. This aircraft was comprised of eight individuals, in-cluding four high school students. The honor-able crew quickly departed towards the vicinity of the last known position of the aircraft. At this time, weather conditions were deterio-rating, and seas were a rough 3 to 5 feet. The wreckage of the aircraft was found before dark, and it was clear that there were like-ly no possible survivors. The next morning, emergency services called TBUS seeking their assistance in locating the aircraft on the sea floor. While local first responders focused on chasing floating debris offshore, the TBUS crew investigated where the plane struck the water using sonar to locate the wreckage. By 4:00 PM on February 14, 2022, TBUS con-firmed they had found the crash site and had remotely operated vehicle footage of the de-bris on the bottom. That night, TBUS crews would be tasked with running the dive oper-ations, while providing divers and surface sup-port for body recovery. The next day, February 15, 2022, TBUS had put together a dive plan and divers to try and access the aircraft. Water temperatures were around 52 degrees on the surface, the current was running approximately 3.9 knots on the bottom in 60 feet of water, and seas were rough at 3 to 5 feet, making this an ex-traordinarily difficult dive to achieve with lim-ited bottom time. TBUS crews worked until the next day, when all the remains had been re-covered for the families. While this was a strenuous job, the selfless heroes at TBUS thought it was a necessary mission to help the grieving families of the victims. Putting divers in during small craft conditions, 50-degree water, and heavy currents makes for very dan-gerous conditions that highlight the heroic ac-tions of the TBUS crew. TBUS crew members involved were Lee Sykes, Johnathon Evans, Jay Boone, Crockett Henderson, Luis Herron and John Wilson. None of this would have been possible were it not for the selflessness and servant attitude of the aforementioned members. Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring these in-credible and wonderful heroes. \n",

      "Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ d’Artenay, Sr., who passed away on Sunday, January 23, 2022. Mr. d’Artenay was born in Hanford, California on June 29, 1943. He was raised in nearby Kettleman City where he first began helping his father on the farm. His interest in farming and agriculture continued to grow while attending Avenal High School. After graduation, Mr. d’Artenay chose to stay in the industry and started his first busi-ness, d’Artenay Hay Service, early in his ca-reer. In the 1980s, he started d’Artenay Farms in Coalinga, California, where he successfully grew pistachios for over thirty years. Mr. d’Artenay was also a fixture in the local racing community. He served as a founding member and president of the Avenal Sand Drags Association. He became known for his sand drag race car, ‘The Red Warrior.’ Mr. d’Artenay was a valued member of our local community, and it is with great pride that I rec-ognize him for his service to the Central Val-ley. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ d’Artenay, Sr. IN MEMORIAM—ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ FOOTE HON. TRACEY MANN OF KANSAS  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, April 6, 2022 Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the memory of Bob Foote, a tremendous Kansan who passed away on March 25th. Bob was a man of many talents. He built one of the largest cattle operations in America, feeding 550,000 head a year and employing 400. He and his wife Gail also built an amazing family who will carry on his legacy and lead the Foote Cattle Company into the future. Bob had tenacity, grit, confidence, and he wasn’t afraid to embrace an aggressive ap-proach to business. His motto was ‘‘Get It’’— which he would say to remind those around him to never give up and keep pushing for-ward. Bob was a staunch conservative who could often be found giving one of his trade-mark ‘‘Bob Foote lectures’’ on politics. He was a true patriot, and most importantly, now that he has gone on to heaven, he was a man of great faith. From the farm and headquarters in eastern Kansas, to ranchland in the Flint Hills, to feed yards in Western Kansas. I am hard pressed to think of any Ag producer who had such an impact on the entirety of Kansas agriculture. Whether he was buying cattle or sharing his faith and work ethic with his grandchildren, Bob believed that he should use the talents that God gave him to be the best man he could be. He is now able to reunite with his beloved Colleen and together watch over his legacy—the Foote Cattle Company—and gaze proudly on his spouse Gail and sons Scott, Brad, and Greg as they continue to lead the industry and Kansas Agriculture forward. May Bob Foote rest in peace. \n",

Enterprise Native, Head Coach, and friend, Coach Rhett Harrelson, led his team to their first-ever Wildcat 7A championship win. This team showed dedication and determination this season as they rallied around one another for the final game. To the players, Keion Dunlap, Jordan Hines, Elijah Terry, Tomar Hobdy, Kenneth Mitchell, Jr., Tre Kemmerlin, Mykel Johnson, Eric Winters, Dylan Baldwin, Tristan Agard, Quentin Hayes, Matther Reed, Nick Roberts, Talmadge Sessions, and Reese Dowling, cherish this win and continue to rep-resent the wildcats with the same attitude you showed throughout the season and through long hours of practice. You knew as a team what it meant to get to this point in your bas-ketball career and how to accomplish the goals you set for your team and yourself. Cel-ebrate this win and remember the legacy you are creating as the first team in Enterprise his-tory to win the championship. To assistant coaches and staff Clark Quisenberry, John Wadsworth, and Keith Sesions, I thank them for molding these stu-dents into the young men that we see today. I thank them for their dedication to their stu-dent-athletes as they worked long hours to teach them not only how to play the game well, but also how to love the sport. I know they will cherish this win and will continue to mentor students for years to come. To the fans, we thank them for always going the extra mile to be at games and always making sure their team was represented throughout the season. As a fellow wildcat, I want to honor this amazing team for all that they have accom-plished, and I can’t wait to see their legacy continue. May this commemoration forever be preserved. AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW ACT SPEECH OF  HON. GARRET GRAVES OF LOUISIANA  IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 31, 2022 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli should have doz-ens of jailbird colleagues for the unethical practices of many in the pharmaceutical indus-try. There is no question that the price of insu-lin, EpiPens, asthma inhalers and hundreds of other drugs are multiple times what they should be and that needs to change. While I support the goal of H.R. 6833, as written the bill does nothing to actually lower the price of insulin—and zero for other drugs. The bill sim-ply mandates that the out-of-pocket cost not exceed $35 for insulin. If you think insurance companies are just going to eat this extra cost then I’ve got a bridge to sell. Insurance com-panies will simply increase premiums to cover the extra cost. This means everyone pays more. It’s a shell game. Obamacare has been a mess and that law doesn’t need any help in further raising insurance premiums. For that reason, I will vote ‘NAY’ for the bill. The solu-tion here is to actually lower the cost of the prescriptions. This can be done by stopping patent abuse by pharmaceutical companies, allowing importation of drugs from countries with appropriate quality control, and incentivizing generic manufacturers. H.R. 19 is a bill that takes steps in the right direction. I would vote for that, but I am working with an-other bipartisan group on a better solution. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5633. This bill requires the OIG to submit to Congress any report that substantiates a violation of specified provi-sions regarding prohibited personnel practices, protected communications, or retaliatory per-sonnel actions. The bill also requires the OIG to submit to Congress any report about a violation of Presi-dential Personnel Directive–19 (protecting whistleblowers with access to classified infor-mation); or an allegation of misconduct, waste, fraud, abuse, or a violation of policy within DHS involving a senior DHS official. The OIG must make each report publicly available on its website, with some exceptions. The bill requires the OIG’s semiannual reports to include specified information regarding ongoing audits, inspections, and evaluations. Mr. Speaker, the importance of this bill cannot be understated. Inspectors General are in-credibly important in the justice process, and especially so when Homeland Security is under review. The Department of Homeland Security has one of the hardest jobs of all federal agencies: protecting the homeland from terror. As a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am fervently committed to overseeing and improving the Department of Homeland Security and keeping America safe from terrorism. One way we do that is through enforcing accountability in all the Department’s functions, which is the purpose of this bill. To underscore its importance, I want to remind this body of critical reports from the Of-fice of Inspector General in the Department of Homeland Security in 2018 and 2019. They brought to light the cruel humanitarian situa-tion migrants were suffering through under the previous administration’s zero-tolerance immi-gration policies. In 2018, the Office of Inspector General released a scathing report detailing the previous administration’s child separation policy. The details of the report were damning. Specifically, it stated that: Department of Homeland Security was not prepared to deal with the staggering repercussions of sepa-rating children from their parents and there was no computer or automated system to fa-cilitate the reunification of parents after they have been separated. The OIG determined that, despite a 72-hour limit on the time a child may be separated from their parents, many children were sepa-rated for five days, and some as long as a dozen days. The report concluded that the government failed to adequately notify parents of the child separation policy, and the process to initiate reunification. The OIG found that government officials gave inconsistent information to parents arriv-ing at the border, which had the effect of instituting confusion at these ports of entry. The report made special note of how the former Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristjen Nielsen signed off on the actions which led to the child separation policy, which is in stark contrast to Secretary Nielsen’s May 15, 2018, testimony to the United States Sen-ate. In another report published in 2019, the Office of Inspector General discussed the pitiful conditions for those being held in detention fa-cilities along the border. During the Inspector General’s visits to five Border Patrol facilities and two ports of entry in the Rio Grande Valley, they reviewed com-pliance with CBP’s Transport, Escort, Deten-tion and Search (TEDS) standards, which gov-ern CBP’s interaction with detained individ-uals, and observed serious overcrowding and prolonged detention of unaccompanied alien children (UACs), families, and single adults that require immediate attention. Specifically, Border Patrol was holding about 8,000 detainees in custody at the time of our visit, with 3,400 held longer than the 72 hours generally permitted under the TEDS standards. Of those 3,400 detainees, Border Patrol held 1,500 for more than 10 days. In addition to the overcrowding they observed, Border Patrol’s custody data indicates that 826 (31 percent) of the 2,669 children at these facilities had been held longer than the 72 hours generally permitted under the TEDS standards and the Flores Agreement. For example, of the 1,031 UACs held at the Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, TX, 806 had already been processed and were awaiting transfer to HHS custody. Of the 806 that were already processed, 165 had been in custody longer than a week. Additionally, there were more than 50 UACs younger than 7 years old, and some of them had been in custody over two weeks while awaiting transfer. In addition to holding roughly 30 percent of minor detainees for longer than 72 hours, sev-eral Rio Grande Valley facilities struggled to meet other TEDS standards for UACs and families. For example, children at three of the five Border Patrol facilities the Inspector General visited had no access to showers, despite the TEDS standards requiring that ‘‘reasonable ef-forts’’ be made to provide showers to children approaching 48 hours in detention. At these facilities, children had limited access to a change of clothes; Border Patrol had few spare clothes for the children and no laun-dry facilities. While all facilities had infant for-mula, diapers, baby wipes, and juice and snacks for children, the Inspector General ob-served that two facilities had not provided chil-dren access to hot meals—as is required by the TEDS standards—until the week the In-spector General arrived. Instead, the children were fed sandwiches and snacks for their meals. Additionally, while Border Patrol tried to provide the least restric-tive setting available for children (e.g., by leav-ing holding room doors open), the limited space for medical isolation resulted in some UACs and families being held in closed cells. These investigations and reports provide just a snapshot of the work the Office of In-spector General under the Department of Homeland Security does. Time and time again, they have shone a much-needed light on affairs that are all of public interest.  It is for that reason Mr. Speaker I strongly support H.R. 5633. It will hold all decision makers accountable and force their actions to be submitted not only to Congress, but the court of public opin-ion as well. This bill prioritizes both transparency and accountability, so I urge my colleagues to sup-port this critical piece of legislation. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1540, the Reporting Ef-ficiently to Proper Officials in Response to Ter-rorism Act of 2021 or the REPORT Act. The purpose of this bill is to provide reports to Congress that are jointly developed by rel-evant federal agencies regarding incidents of terrorism. This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Depart-ment of Justice and the Federal Bureau of In-vestigation, whenever an incident of terrorism occurs in the United States, to submit to Con-gress an unclassified report upon completion of the investigation by the primary U.S. gov-ernment agency conducting the investigation concerning the incident. The report should contain: 1. A statement of the facts of the incident that are known at the time of the report. 2. Any recommendations for changes in practices or law, consistent with the Constitu-tion, with particular attention to changes that could help prevent future incidents of ter-rorism. The bipartisan bill requires the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, and/or the National Counterterrorism Center to work together to submit a report to Congress after a foreign or domestic terrorist attack, which must include an explanation of what happened, any gaps in national security, and recommendations for additional measures to improve homeland security and prevent fu-ture terrorist attacks. After a terrorist attack, federal agencies will be required to report to Congress with infor-mation about exactly what happened and rec-ommendations to prevent future attacks. The first priority of government should be making sure that all Americans are safe, se-cure, and free. The 9/11 attack on American soil on September 11, 2001 took the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent civilians and since that day, the role of virtually every federal, state, and local law enforcement agency changed. The 9/11 attack remains a tragedy that defines our nation’s history. But the final chapter will be written by those who are charged with keeping our nation and people safe while pre-serving the way of life that terrorists sought to change. On January 6, 2021, during a joint session of Congress, a mob breached the U.S. Cap-itol, illegally entering the complex, violent par-ticipants, incited by the former President’s rhetoric, injured scores of D.C. Police and U.S. Capitol Police officers—killing one, while four civilians also died. The escalation in violent domestic attacks since the January 6 attack has been felt by our nation’s law enforcement officers, as well as others which is evidenced by the rise in murder and assaults across the nation. Today, we find ourselves in a nation where the terrorism landscape is more complex, it is imperative that we recognize and commu-nicate the evolving and unorthodox nature of the terrorism threats we face today. This bill is the most effective way for us to protect our country through solid reporting and communicating. To prevent terrorist attacks and ensure efficiency and effectiveness in responding to an attack, agencies need to coordinate with each other to determine what went wrong so that we can strengthen our counterterrorism efforts moving forward. Congress must have all available information to make the most informed policy deci-sions following a terrorist attack. The REPORT Act ensures that members of Congress will receive the full accounting of the facts, so that they can hold federal agencies accountable. Information sharing with both Congress and the American people, is a vital element of pre-venting, and responding to, terrorism. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1540 because our mission has been and will continue to be focused on preventing and preparing for all issues surrounding terrorism. We owe a debt to those who have lost their lives and we must do all that we can to pre-vent another attack on United States soil. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4209, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Illicit Cross-Border Tun-nel Defense Act.’’ This bill authorizes for FY2022 and FY2023 U.S. Customs and Border Protection activities to identify and close tunnels criminals use to illegally cross our Southern Border. This bill also directs the Customs and Border Patrol to develop and report to Congress a strategic plan to improve tunnel closures. According to Customs and Border Patrol, Cross-border tunnels are dug by transnational criminal organizations to smuggle contraband into the U.S. from neighboring countries. Cur-rent detection capabilities rely on random tips and the laborious collection of human intel-ligence (HUMINT). When tunnels are discovered, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have limited ability to access the tunnel to arrest and prosecute those involved in creating and using the tun-nel. The reason behind such limited ability is because Customs and Border Patrol lack the needed fiscal resources needed to combat tunnel construction and usage. This bill aims to ameliorate that problem. Mr. Speaker, after considering statements from Customs and Border Patrol, it is clear that people seeking a better life do not use il-legal tunnels to achieve such ends. The tun-nels are instead used by those seeking to wreak havoc and bring crime into our commu-nities, with no other purpose. For example, upon discovery of a 183-foot- long subterranean tunnel in Mexicali, Baja California, near the international border, Cardell T. Morant, special agent in charge of HSI San Diego said, ‘‘These types of tunnels enable drug traffickers to conduct illicit activi-ties virtually undetected across the U.S.–Mex-ico border.’’ Morant continued, ‘‘Discovering and shutting down these tunnels deals a major blow to drug trafficking organizations because it de-nies them the ability to smuggle drugs, weap-ons and people across the border.’’ That tunnel had an entrance measuring 12 feet by 10 feet and extended 3 feet north of the international border wall but had no exit on the U.S. side of the border, apparently cre-ating temporary exits on an ad hoc basis. The Drug Trafficking Organization who designed it equipped the tunnel with electricity, ventilation, a rail system with a cart, and an electric hoist. Mr. Speaker, these tunnels, even if they are only open for a short period, can allow traf-fickers to move massive amounts of drugs, humans, currency, and firearms back-and-forth between Mexico and the United States. As Chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Committee, I am com-mitted to ensuring our internal and homeland security. Fighting these criminals at every turn is critical to achieving of that objective, and this bill provides the CBP additional tools for that purpose. I am therefore proud to support H.R. 4209, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act’’ and urge my colleagues to as well. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4476, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Trade and Economic Security Council Act of 2021.’’ This bill establishes the DHS Trade and Economic Security Council, which shall pro-vide trade and economic security advice and recommendations to the Department of Home-land Security (DHS). This includes identifying high priority risks and setting priorities for protecting the nation’s trade and economic security. The bill also establishes the position of Assistant Secretary for Trade and Economic Se-curity within DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans. Mr. Speaker, the mission of the Department of Homeland Security is to secure the nation from the many threats we face. Those threats encompass not only threats abroad but also at home, and our economic security is integral to national security.  Securing our economy means we will have safeguards in place to help prevent another economic disaster like the one brought about by the COVID–19 pandemic, from which countless Americans suffered. The COVID–19 pandemic and resulting economic fallout caused significant hardship. In the early months of the crisis, tens of millions of people lost their jobs. While employment began to rebound within a few months, unemployment remained high throughout 2020. Improving employment and substantial relief measures helped reduce the very high levels of hardship seen in the summer of 2020. Nonetheless, considerable unmet needs remained near the end of 2021, with 20 million households reporting having too little to eat in the past seven days and 10 million house-holds behind on rent. In early 2022, some 3 million fewer people are employed than before the pandemic, though steady progress has been made, in-cluding in recent months. Hardship in 2020 and 2021 would have been far worse without the extraordinary steps taken by the federal government, states, and localities to respond to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Key hardship indicators showed strong improvement during early 2021, aided by job growth and government benefits. Hardship rates fell especially fast thanks to the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 11, 2021, which included $1,400 payments for most Americans as well as other assistance to struggling households. Food hardship among adults with children also fell after the federal government began issuing monthly payments of the enhanced and expanded Child Tax Credit, which was first distributed on July 15, 2021, along with improvements in food assistance. While those measures taken by the Biden Administration were swift and, I believe, life-saving, much of the suffering the American people went through could have been miti-gated through extensive planning. This bill provides those means, which drives my support. No more Americans should suffer because the federal government refused to plan in the case of a disaster. The DHS Trade and Economic Security Council Act of 2021 is a legislative embodi-ment of that understanding, so I am proud to support it. I urge my colleagues to as well. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 831, which reaffirms unequivocal support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an alliance founded on democratic principles. This resolution also calls on the President to use the voice and vote of the United States to adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that is clear about its support for shared demo-cratic values and committed to enhancing NATO’s capacity to strengthen democratic in-stitutions within NATO member, partner, and aspirant countries. Finally, the resolution calls on the President to use the voice and vote of the United States to establish a Center for Democratic Resil-ience within NATO headquarters. First, I would like to commend all Ukrainians for their outstanding courage, resilience, for-titude, and bravery. It is truly inspiring for Americans, and for people around the world. America stands with Ukraine and the Ukrain-ian people. Russia’s launch of a premeditated war against Ukraine is an attack on democracy and a grave violation of international law, glob-al peace, and security. The fighting has sparked massive displacement and has forced over two million Ukrain-ians to flee their homes to neighboring states and has put women and girls at heightened risk of violence. Although the world hopes for peace, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no signs of ending. Russian forces continue their bom-bardment of Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, and the southern port city of Mariupol. Additionally, as a body we must condemn the recent execution style killings of Ukrain-ians in Bucha. It is abundantly clear that Russian soldiers were out to torture, rape, and kill innocent Ukrainian civilians. These actions amount to war crimes, and we must treat them as such. Therefore, along with the President I believe we must hold Russian authorities and Presi-dent Putin accountable before the International Criminal Court via a War Crimes trial. This will bring the justice so greatly deserved to those families who lost their moth-ers, fathers, sons, and daughters to savagery. I additionally believe that this is a good first action under NATO’s new Strategic Concept, which this bill seeks to redefine. Considering the direness of the situation in Ukraine, it is absolutely critical that NATO  powers continue to bind together in opposition to President Putin’s soulless actions. Adopting a new Strategic Concept and establishing a Center for Democratic Resilience will further display to Putin and those like him that the West will not back down to autocrats and dictators. I therefore am proud to support H. Res 831, and urge my colleagues to do the same. \n",

      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4738, the ‘‘COVID–19 American History Project Act.’’ This bill directs the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress to establish the COVID–19 American History Project which will collect and make publicly available individual stories and records of experiences during the COVID–19 pandemic in the United States. The bill includes a requirement to collect video and audio histories and testimonials of those who were affected by the pandemic. Madam Speaker, the United States will soon reach a grave milestone. As of 9 o’clock this morning, there have been 974,277 American deaths from COVID–19. In the coming weeks, we will reach 1,000,000 deaths. However, I believe that only focusing on that horrific number, though nonetheless important, makes us forget about who we lost. Therefore, with this time I would like to tell the stories of my fellow Houstonians who sadly passed because of this unprecedented public health crisis. The stories I will be recounting are all courtesy of Houston Public Media, of whose jour-nalists I have been a strong supporter. Knowing that his daughter would be unable to walk at her college graduation commence-ment due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Dr. Carlos Araujo-Preza threw his daughter, An-drea Araujo, a belated graduation celebration with her close friends and family in late Octo-ber. She said he really put in the effort to give her the best ceremony he could. Dr. Araujo-Preza always went out of his way to make sure his daughter and her brother were taken care of, despite a busy work schedule at Tomball Regional Hospital. The siblings and their father spent their weekends together binge-watching movies and TV shows together. But in 2020, Andrea Araujo was forced to spend her 23rd birthday without her father. Araujo-Preza was two weeks away from receiving his first round of the COVID–19 vac-cine before he passed away. He died Nov. 30, 2020, at the age of 51. He knew at a young age he was meant to pursue a career in the medical field. Coming from a family of doctors himself, Araujo-Preza was viewed as a loving caregiver and some-one his patients could always rely on. Araujo-Preza was the leading doctor at his hospital who specialized in plasma research, while also distributing COVID–19 vaccines to nurses. ‘‘His colleagues were fans of him,’’ she said. ‘‘They loved when he came into work.’’ He would go out of his way to give his personal phone number to patients and would ac-commodate their needs at any time of day. Araujo said her father would wake up as early as 3 a.m. to go into work. Araujo-Preza would sleep in the hospital for days and sometimes weeks at a time to always be on call for his patients. Now, Araujo said she tries to live by a saying her father used to share in Spanish: ‘‘The sun always rises the next day.’’ Araujo-Preza would tell his children to not let daily chal-lenges in life hold them back. Because, he said, as life goes on, you should too. ‘‘I feel like people always say, ‘with time, things get better’, but I’ve noticed it’s quite the opposite,’’ she said. ‘‘Every day gets harder.’’ That story was courtesy of Emily Jaroszewski at Houston Public Media. The next story is one that is especially close to my heart: Dick Cigler from the University of Houston. Those who were mentored by Dick Cigler would tell you he left a lasting impression as one of the most influential staff members at the Daily Cougar—a highly regarded cham-pion of free speech at the University of Hous-ton’s newspaper. ‘‘He taught us about the importance of journalism,’’ said Tanya Eiserer, an Emmy-award winning reporter for WFAA in Dallas and former Daily Cougar student editor. ‘‘He really taught us the importance of doing the right thing, doing it for the right reasons, and stand-ing up for the underdog.’’ Nowhere was that more evident than when, in the 1990s, a group of UH journalists wrote a series of articles challenging the decreased university budget for UH downtown students and the increased budget for subsidiary cam-puses. Dick allowed the students to voice their concerns brazenly. ‘‘He didn’t try to, you know, tell us to back down,’’ Eiserer said. ‘‘He ran interference, and they knew that we were an independent news operation.’’ Eiserer remembers Cigler as being a listening ear and a guiding mentor when she trans-ferred from Baylor University to UH. She re-garded him as one of the people who helped her become the reporter she is today. ‘‘I learned how to be a journalist at the Daily Cougar,’’ said Eiserer. ‘‘I would not give that time back for all the money in the world.’’ Cigler worked as Director of UH’s Student Publications department, now known as the Center for Student Media, for 23 years until his retirement in 2010. His impact on the Daily Cougar can be felt to this day. Cigler died on Jan. 24, 2021, at the age of 79. He leaves behind his two daughters Kerri Runge and Michelle Cigler. That story was courtesy of Myrakel Baker at Houston Public Media. The last individual I want to mention is someone who is a local hero but should be a national one. That person was John Bland. More than 60 years ago, a group of Texas Southern University students took seats at the lunch counter at Weingarten’s Supermarket at 4110 Almeda Road, knowing they wouldn’t be served. It was Houston’s first sit-in, and that spring, Black college students in cities across the country forced the beginning of an end to ra-cial segregation—at lunch counters, depart-ment stores, and city halls. One of the TSU students at the sit-in was John Bland, a 20-year-old who spent the rest of his life working to advance civil rights and equal opportunity. Bland worked as a bus operator at HouTran, now called Metro, and he spent more than 50 years organizing with the Trans-port Workers Union. He served as a vice president of the Texas State AFL-CIO, a presi-dent of the Houston chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, a precinct judge, and a member of the Houston Police Department Citizen Review Committee. ‘‘When workers would doubt their ability to beat the odds and make change, Mr. Bland would say, ‘When we fought for integration in the 1960s, they arrested me 27 times, jailed me, and fined me, but that didn’t stop us,’ ’’ Hany Khalil, Executive Director of the Texas Gulf Coast Area Labor Federation, said. Bland died on July 9, 2020, at the age of 80. He leaves behind his wife, Betty Davis Bland, and their two daughters and grandson. That story was courtesy of Jen Rice at Houston Public Media. I wish I could mention every Houstonian and honor their lives because they all deserve it. They were mothers, wives, fathers, husbands, sons, daughters, and so much more. They will all be missed and are not just another num-ber. It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I strongly support H.R. 4738 and urge my col-leagues to support it as well. \n",
      "NEXT SPEECH--------\n",
      "Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a senior member of this body and the Com-mittee on the Judiciary, I want to offer praise and a message of appreciation for a beloved man, who served as a member of my personal staff in service of the constituents of the 18th Congressional District of Texas, located in the city of Houston. He was a member of the baby boom generation that directly benefited from and was in-spired by the work of President John F. Ken-nedy, President Lyndon Banes Johnson, Mar-tin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and many other leaders that worked for equality and jus-tice for all. I am proud but heart-broken to later today participate in a tribute to his service in the U.S. House of Representatives, because Gregory Berry is an American original, my friend and valued member of my staff who died on March 15, 2022, at the age of 66 years old. Gregory Alan Berry, long-time legislative counsel in the U.S. House of Representatives, died unexpectedly from hypertension on March 15, 2022, at his home in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Greg was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on February 16, 1956, the second son of Jesse Frank Berry and Bonnie Allena Berry. His fa-ther preceded him in death. He is survived by  his mother; his two sons, Michael Jeffrey Berry and Connor Sias Berry, and their mother Elva Bowden Berry; his two brothers, Jeffrey (Donene) and Michael Berry, his sister, Bonnie Berry LaMon (Andre ´); two nieces, one nephew, two great-nieces, one great-nephew, five aunts and four uncles. When Greg was four years old, his family moved to California where he attended various schools including Saddleback High School in Santa Ana. He graduated from Evergreen High School in Seattle after his family moved there the summer before his senior year. Greg played both baseball and football in high school but was best known for his copi-ous understanding of current political events, his debate skills, and his ability to recite on- demand the famous speeches of Abraham Lincoln and other seminal politicians and ora-tors. Greg graduated from the University of Washington with a B.A. in Business Adminis-tration. In 1980, he obtained his J.D from Uni-versity of Pennsylvania Law School. Greg began his career as a Senior Attorney- Advisor in the U.S. Department of Energy, Of-fice of Hearing Appeals, where he received the DOE Special Achievement Award for su-perior performance and sustained excellence and originality in legal analysis, research, and writing. Four years later he became a Senior Trial Attorney in the Office of General Counsel at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, where he received several Special Achieve-ment and High Quality Awards as well as Cer-tificates of Appreciation for Outstanding Per-formance. Greg excelled at both these positions, but the call on his heart and mind since the early 1960s had always been American politics. In 1989 he answered that call by matriculating into the University of Michigan Political Science Department. He graduated in 1991 with an M.A. in American Politics and Govern-ment, and within two years thereafter had completed all coursework and qualifying exams in connection with a Ph.D from the same program. While still a Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan, Greg accepted a position as Vis-iting Lecturer of Political Science at the Uni-versity of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. He taught several courses in American national government, politics, and American polit-ical thought. The University of Canterbury offered him a full-time position and he returned to the Uni-versity of Michigan where he taught introduc-tory and advanced courses in American poli-tics, government, political theory, race and pol-itics, and political communication. He then taught similar courses at James Madison University, in Virginia, before accept-ing a position as Legal Writing Professor at Howard University School of Law (HUSL), in Washington, D.C. At HUSL he taught litigation related courses, Legal Reasoning, Research and Writing, Ap-pellate Advocacy, and Legal Methods. He was the Faculty Advisor to an award- winning National Moot Court Team and was voted ‘‘Law Professor of the Year’’ in 2003, and several times received the Warren S. Romarin Award for Excellence in Teaching and Service. In 2006, Greg ‘‘entered Congress’’ as my Legislative Director/Senior Policy Adviser. I knew then that I had found an extraordinary mind to serve in my personal office and the Hill had a great scholar who would con-tribute to the work of this great democracy. Gregory over the years, also served as Legislative Counsel to Representative Barbara Lee (D–CA). At the time of his passing Greg had worked for nine years as my Chief Counsel and Legis-lative Director. He enjoyed developing, drafting, and managing legislation for the Appropriations, Judici-ary, Foreign Affairs, Transportation & Infra-structure, Homeland Security, Science, and Rules Committees. He negotiated with senior staff officials in the House leadership and standing commit-tees, frequently on behalf of the office. He sat in countless meetings with Executive Department officials at the federal and state level, and often met with lobbyists and policy entrepreneurs to garner support for important legislative initiatives. He especially enjoyed writing statements and speeches for delivery in committee hear-ings and markups; before the Rules Com-mittee and on the House floor; in the congres-sional district, across the nation, and abroad; and for print, electronic, and online media. In his capacity as Legislative Director, Greg thrived on supervising, mentoring, and training the junior staff of legislative assistants, cor-respondents, and interns. Greg was also a kind hearted person who treated everyone with dignity and respect. His family is exceedingly grateful to Greg’s colleagues and friends on the Hill for sharing his love of public service in the United States House of Representatives because he was able to spend the last sixteen years of his life steeped in the political world which unrelentingly captured his imagination as a young boy. A fitting and proper means of paying tribute to Gregory Berry’s extraordinary life is to join with family, friends and co-workers to salute this great democracy, which he loved without ceasing through his years of dedicated serv-ice. I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory and thanks of Gregory Alan Berry, the three year old boy who visited the Capitol with his mother who returned to work in the job that gave him immense joy. \n"

Madam Speaker, I rise today to read a letter from the Dudykevych family, who are originally from Ukraine and are now living in Tega Cay, South Carolina. They still have family who refuse to leave their homes and their country which, as we all know by now, is under brutal at-tack by the Russians. The father of the Dudykevych family literally built their home with his own hands, which is now being destroyed for one reason and one reason alone— they desire freedom. The heartfelt letter reads like this: ‘‘To President Biden and to Members of the 117th Congress of the United States of America, we highly appre-ciate your legislative initiatives and clear stance against the cruel and dia-bolic Russian aggression against Ukraine. ‘‘Today, I am urgently asking you to actively support immediate delivery of Eastern European fighter planes to Ukraine. The brave Ukrainian Army and the country’s heroic citizens are winning the war on the ground. ‘‘The problem is that Ukraine’s cities are being destroyed and the citizens are being murdered from the air. I am requesting your urgent help in con-vincing the White House that imme-diate delivery of MiG planes to Ukraine should be the highest priority in support of a free Ukraine. ‘‘What we are witnessing is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. We have an ability in this country and in the allied bases in Europe to stop these murderous attacks from the air. We have a moral obligation to do so. Our words are meant to reinforce President Zelenskyy’s urgent demand for fighter planes. ‘‘Ukrainian cities are lying in ruins, and thousands of citizens are dead and will keep dying because Ukraine’s de-nial of fighter jets. These planes will protect the Ukrainian sky from Rus-sian air raids. ‘‘There are MiG–29 warplanes sitting at Allied bases in Europe ready for an immediate transfer. Ukrainian pilots are well-trained on these warplanes and can use them to stop the mur-derous attacks from the air tonight. ‘‘We can no longer sit back and watch schools, hospitals, homes, apart-ment buildings, bomb shelters, every-day people of all ages being mass mur-dered on a daily basis. ‘‘The news that a mother in labor and her unborn baby died after a maternity ward was bombed in Mariupol broke my heart. It is a tragedy that could have been prevented if Ukraine had the planes to defend the sky. ‘‘I know you deal with many requests, but this is an existential need. Ukraine will not survive without your support. Nothing means more to me at this moment. The world is in desperate need of American leadership. Sin-cerely, Mila Dudykevych.’’ This letter was emailed to me 12 days ago on Sunday, March 27, at 2:50 p.m. We all have seen the death and destruc-tion that has occurred since this date, all which could have been avoided if this President had exercised leadership months ago by allowing for the release of the fighter jets, which he failed then and continues to fail now by refusing to honor the request of a desperate Ukrainian people whose only desire is to live in a free country for which they are willing to fight and die. President Biden, the Ukrainian people and all the free people around the world do not deserve this type of bla-tant incompetence and willful neglect by the leader of the free world. Histo-rians will record this truly sad course of events for all the world to see in the coming months and years. Mr. Presi-dent, the words that will be recorded in the annals of history will not be kind. ']}\n",

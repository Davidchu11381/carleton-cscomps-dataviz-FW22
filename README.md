# Is a Dollar Worth a Thousand Words? Visualizing the Connections Between U.S. Congress Membersâ€™ Funding and Speech

The goal of this project is allow users to discover connections between industries that fund members of Congress and statements made by those members via interactive data visualizations.

Users are able to input a arbitrary subset of congresspeople and then three visualizations will be displayed:

1. A Sankey diagram showing the breakdown of the top 10 industries that fund the congressperson(s).

2. A Sankey diagram showing the breakdown of the distribution of the topics found in the congressperson(s) Tweets.

3. A Sankey diagram showing the breakdown of the distribution of the topics found in the congressperson(s) congressional statements.
